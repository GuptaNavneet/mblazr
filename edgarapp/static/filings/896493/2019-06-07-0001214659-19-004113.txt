for customers generally are not entitled to vote on &ldquo;non-routine&rdquo; matters, unless they receive voting instructions
from their customers. As used herein, &ldquo;uninstructed shares&rdquo; means shares held by a broker who has not received such
instructions from its customers on a proposal. A &ldquo;broker non-vote&rdquo; occurs when a nominee holding uninstructed shares
for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with
respect to that non-routine matter. In connection with the treatment of abstentions and broker non-votes, all but one of the proposals
at this are considered &ldquo;non-routine&rdquo; matters, and brokers are not entitled to vote uninstructed shares with respect
to these proposals. Only the proposal to ratify the appointment of Marcum LLP, as the Company&rsquo;s independent registered public
accounting firm, is a routine matter that brokers are entitled to vote upon without receiving instructions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Abstentions will be treated as shares present for quorum
purposes and entitled to vote, but will have no impact on votes cast as none of the Proposals requires the favorable vote of a

which case an abstention will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner of shares
held in &ldquo;street name&rdquo; does not give instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares as to how to vote on matters
deemed &ldquo;non-routine.&rdquo; Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled
to give voting instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions,
the broker or nominee can still vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be &ldquo;routine,&rdquo; but not
with respect to &ldquo;non-routine&rdquo; matters. Under the rules and interpretations of the New York Stock Exchange, &ldquo;non-routine&rdquo;
matters include director elections (whether contested or uncontested) and matters involving a contest or a matter that may substantially
affect the rights or privileges of stockholders.</P>

non-votes, the proposals at this meeting to (i) elect directors, (ii) approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named
executive officers, (iii) approval a frequency of &ldquo;Three Years&rdquo; for future advisory votes on executive compensation;
(iv) approve the Nisser Employment Agreement, and (v) the amendment to the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan, are considered &ldquo;non-routine&rdquo;
matters, and brokers are not entitled to vote uninstructed shares with respect to these proposals. The proposals to (a) ratify
the appointment of Marcum, LLP, as the Company&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm and (b) approve the amendment
to the Company&rsquo;s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split are routine matters that brokers are entitled
to vote upon without receiving instructions.</P>

In addition to these mailed proxy materials, our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by
other means of communication. The Board has engaged Kingsdale Advisors to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $8,100,
plus an additional per holder fee for any solicitation of individual holders and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Directors
and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies but may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the solicitation. We will also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for their reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Mr. Rosenberg serves as one of our independent directors.
He has served as an independent consultant to various companies in the design and implementation of homeland security systems in
Europe and Africa since 2010. From 2004 to 2009, he served as a special consultant to Bullet Plate Ltd., a manufacturer of armor
protection systems, and NovIdea Ltd., a manufacturer of perimeter and border security systems. From 2000 to 2003, Mr. Rosenberg
was the general manager of ZIV U.P.V.C Products Ltd.'s doors and window factory. Mr. Rosenberg is an active reserve officer and
a retired colonel from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), where he served for 26 years and was involved in the development of weapon
systems. In the IDF, Mr. Rosenberg served in various capacities, including platoon, company, battalion and brigade commander, head
of the training center for all IDF infantry, and head of the Air Force's Special Forces. Mr. Rosenberg received a B.A in History
from the University of Tel Aviv and a Master of Arts in Political Science from the University of Haifa in Israel. We believe that
Mr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s business background give him the qualifications to serve as one of our directors.&nbsp;</P>

for, among other things, assisting our Board in identifying prospective director nominees and recommending nominees for each annual
meeting of stockholders to the Board; developing and recommending governance principles applicable to our Board; overseeing the
evaluation of our Board and management; and recommending potential members for each Board committee to our Board.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Nominating and Governance Committee considers diversity

Our executive officers address and discuss with our Board our risks and the manner in which we manage or mitigate such risks. While
our Board has the ultimate responsibility for our risk oversight, our Board works in conjunction with its committees on certain
aspects of its risk oversight responsibilities. In particular, our Audit Committee focuses on financial reporting risks and related
controls and procedures; our Compensation Committee evaluates the risks associated with our compensation philosophy and programs
and strives to create compensation practices that do not encourage excessive levels of risk taking that would be inconsistent with
our strategies and objectives; and our Nomination and Governance Committee oversees risks associated with our Code of Ethical Conduct.</P>

report of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5 with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and ten
percent shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely
upon our review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all such filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and ten percent
shareholders were fulfilled with the following exceptions:</P>

executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller or person performing similar functions
(collectively, the &ldquo;<B>Financial Managers</B>&rdquo;). The Code of Ethical Conduct is designed to deter wrongdoing and to
promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The full text of our Code of Ethical Conduct
is published on our website at www.digipwr.com. We will disclose any substantive amendments to the Code of Ethical Conduct or any
waivers, explicit or implicit, from a provision of the Code on our website or in a current report on Form 8-K. Upon request to
our CEO, Milton C. Ault, III, we will provide without charge, a copy of our Code of Ethical Conduct.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As with &ldquo;say-on-pay,&rdquo; we provide this vote
pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This item is also an advisory vote, which means that it will not
bind the Company or our Board. We will disclose how many stockholders voted for each of the three options (annual, biennial, or
triennial votes) as well as how many abstained from voting. We last held a vote regarding the frequency of future &ldquo;say-on-pay&rdquo;
votes in 2013. Since then, consistent with the recommendation of our stockholders, we have held &ldquo;say-on-pay&rdquo; advisory
votes every three years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In considering the interests of our shareholders and
the Company, the Board has determined that the recommended frequency for which the Company should hold a stockholder advisory vote
to approve the compensation paid to the Company&rsquo;s named executive officers should be every&nbsp;three (3) years. We believe
that every three (3) years is the appropriate frequency to hold a Say-on-Pay vote for several reasons. As our compensation programs
reward both short-term and long-term performance, shareholder input on executive compensation would be most useful if the effectiveness
of our compensation program is evaluated and judged over a multi-year period. Further, a three year interval provides the Board
and the Compensation Committee with sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of its compensation policies and implement changes
in response to its evaluation and the results of the advisory vote. Thus, the Board recommends that stockholders approve a frequency
of every three (3) years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As your vote on this proposal is advisory and will not
be binding on the Compensation Committee, the Board or the Company, the Board may decide that it is in the best interests of the
Company and our stockholders to hold a stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option
recommended by our stockholders. However, we value the opinions of our stockholders on executive compensation matters and we will
take the results of this advisory vote into consideration when making future decisions regarding the frequency with which the Company
holds a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation paid to the Company&rsquo;s named executive officers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board is submitting the Reverse Stock
Split to our stockholders for approval with the primary intent of increasing the market price of our Common Stock to enhance our
ability to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American and to make our Common Stock more attractive to a broader
range of institutional and other investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, for these and other reasons discussed below, we believe
that effecting the Reverse Stock Split is in the Company&rsquo;s and our stockholders&rsquo; best interests.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Common Stock is listed on the NYSE
American under the symbol &ldquo;DPW.&rdquo; Under the NYSE American&rsquo;s continued listing standards, if the exchange considers
the Common Stock to be a low-priced stock (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time), then the Company&rsquo;s
securities are subject to a below compliance notification. Additionally, if at any time the Common Stock trades below an abnormally
low level per share, then the Company&rsquo;s securities will be automatically delisted from the NYSE American. On December 3,
2018, the Company received a letter from the NYSE American, the receipt of which was announced by the Company on December 5, 2018
(the &ldquo;<B>First NYSE Letter</B>&rdquo;), in which the NYSE American advised the Company that it was concerned about the low
trading price of the Company&rsquo;s shares of Common Stock. Specifically, the First NYSE Letter noted that the average trading
price of the Common Stock was $0.23 during the thirty (30) trading days ended on November 30, 2018. Consequently, the NYSE American
informed the Company that it deems it appropriate for the Company to effectuate a reverse split of the Common Stock and further
advised the Company that it may take further action were the market price of the Common Stock to decline further. In response,
the Company determined that effectuating a reverse split was necessary and began to establish a timeline for the proposed reverse
split, with certain criteria, such as the ratio of the reverse split, to be resolved as soon as practicable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On January 4, 2019, the Company received
a second letter from the NYSE American, the receipt of which was announced by the Company on January 8, 2019 (the &ldquo;<B>Second
NYSE Letter</B>&rdquo;), in which the NYSE American advised the Company that while the Company had not yet effectuated a reverse
split, it was aware of the Company&rsquo;s consideration of such a corporate action. The NYSE American further noted that the Company
was not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American Company Guide (the &ldquo;<B>Company Guide</B>&rdquo;).
Consequently, the Second NYSE Letter informed the Company that the NYSE American had determined that the Common Stock had been
selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and, pursuant to the Company Guide, the Company's continued
listing is predicated on the Company effecting a reverse stock split of the Common Stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price
improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the NYSE determined to be no later than July 4, 2019. To demonstrate such
sustained price improvement, the NYSE American will generally require that: (i) the average closing price of the Common Stock for
the thirty (30)-day period ending and including July 4, 2019 be $0.20 per share or greater; and (ii) the closing price of the common
stock on July 4, 2019 be $0.20 per share or greater.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On February 12, 2019, the Company filed
a definitive proxy statement for a Special Meeting to be held on March 14, 2019, the principal purpose of which was to ask its
stockholders to approve an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect the reverse stock split of its Common Stock
by a ratio of not less than one-for-four and not more than one-for-twenty at any time prior to March 14, 2020, with the exact ratio
to be set at a whole number within this range as determined by our Board in its sole discretion. As such, the proposal was identical
to Proposal 5 of this proxy statement, with the exception of the range within which our Board may, assuming this Proposal 5 is
approved, determine to fix the ratio of the reverse split.</P>

ratio of not less than one-for-four and not more than one-for-twenty at any time prior to March 14, 2020, with the exact ratio
to be set at a whole number within this range as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. The Company reported that 72,253,978

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Later on March 14, 2019, the Company announced
that the Board approved a one-for-twenty reverse split of the Common Stock effective on March 14, 2019 (the &ldquo;<B>March Split</B>&rdquo;).
Beginning with the opening of trading on March 15, 2019, the Common Stock traded on the NYSE American on a split-adjusted basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The March Split reduced the number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding from approximately 125,080,765 to approximately 6,254,038. The authorized number of shares
of Common Stock remained at 500 million.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">While the Company believes that the March
Split achieved the intended objectives, as the closing market price of the Common Stock (&ldquo;<B>CMP</B>&rdquo;) on that date
was $1.68, substantially above the $1.00 market price that the NYSE American prefers the issuers listed on the NYSE American maintain,
and well above the market prices that lead it to issue letters of various kinds to its listed issuers, the Company believes that
it is in its own and its stockholders&rsquo; best interest to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split due to certain deleterious events
that occurred subsequent to March 14, 2019.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The first to occur of these events was
a precipitous drop in the market price near the end of the trading day of March 15, 2019. As noted above, the CMP on March 14,
2019 was $1.68. While this price level was not fully sustained during the trading day of March 15, 2019, in the last few minutes
the price dropped precipitously, with the CMP being $0.71.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The second event that caused a significant
slide in the market price of the Common Stock was the Company&rsquo;s press release dated March 29, 2019, which announced the pricing
of a public offering. On April 3, 2019, the Company announced that this public offering had closed on April 2, 2019. On March 28,
2019, the CMP was approximately $0.71, only slightly lower than the CMP on March 15, 2019, meaning that the CMP was substantially
steady for the two weeks following the March Split. On March 29, 2019, however, the CMP fell to approximately $0.29. This drop
in the market price was clearly occasioned by the announcement of the pricing of the public offering and was entirely unrelated
to the March Split. As of May 31, 2019, the CMP was approximately $0.15, substantially below the level required by the NYSE American
and very significantly below its preferred minimum level of $1.00.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As a result principally of the two events
described above, the Common Stock has not traded above $1.00 per share and $0.30 per share since March 14, 2019 and April 10, 2019,
respectively. Consequently, the Company has requested that its stockholders approved this Proposal 5, which provides for the Reverse
Stock Split.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If we are unable to regain compliance with
NYSE American low-priced continued listing standards in the appropriate time, then the Company&rsquo;s securities will be subject
to delisting. Delisting could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and on the trading of the Common Stock.
If the Common Stock were delisted, then it could be quoted on the OTCQB market or on the &ldquo;pink sheets&rdquo; maintained by
the OTC Markets Group. However, such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets. Further, delisting from
the NYSE American could also have other negative effects, including potential loss of confidence by partners, lenders, suppliers
and employees and could also trigger various defaults under our lending agreements and other outstanding agreements. Finally, delisting
could make it harder for us to raise capital and sell securities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We also believe that the increased market
price of the Common Stock expected as a result of implementing the Reverse Stock Split may improve the marketability and liquidity
of the Common Stock and encourage interest and trading in the Common Stock. Because of the trading volatility often associated
with low-priced stocks, many brokerage houses and institutional investors have internal policies and practices that either prohibit
them from investing in low-priced stocks or tend to discourage individual brokers from recommending low-priced stocks to their
customers. Some of those policies and practices may function to make the processing of trades in low-priced stocks economically
unattractive to brokers. Moreover, because brokers&rsquo; commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage
of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, the current average price per share of the Common Stock can result
in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the
case if the share price were substantially higher. Although it should be noted that the liquidity of the Common Stock may be harmed
by the Reverse Stock Split given the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the Reverse Stock Split, our Board
is hopeful that the anticipated higher market price will offset, to some extent, the negative effects on the liquidity and marketability
of the Common Stock inherent in some of the policies and practices of institutional investors and brokerage houses described above.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Reducing the number of outstanding shares
of our Common Stock through the Reverse Stock Split is intended, absent other factors, to increase the per share market price of
our Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other factors, such as our financial results, market conditions and the market perception
of our business may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, there can be no assurance that
the Reverse Stock Split, if completed, will result in the intended benefits described above, that the market price of our Common
Stock will increase following the Reverse Stock Split or that the market price of our Common Stock will not decrease in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we cannot assure you that the market price per share of our Common Stock after a Reverse Stock Split will increase in proportion
to the reduction in the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the Reverse Stock Split.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
the total market capitalization of our Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split may be lower than the total market capitalization
before the Reverse Stock Split.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Reverse Stock Split, if approved by
our stockholders, would become effective upon the filing (the &ldquo;<B>Effective Time</B>&rdquo;) of a certificate of amendment
to the Company&rsquo;s Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact
timing of the filing of the certificate of amendment that will effectuate the Reverse Stock Split will be determined by our Board
based on its evaluation as to when such action will be the most advantageous to the&nbsp;Company and our stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, our Board reserves the right, notwithstanding stockholder approval and without further action by the stockholders, to
elect not to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split if, at any time prior to filing the amendment to the Company&rsquo;s Certificate
of Incorporation, our Board, in its sole discretion, determines that it is no longer in our best interest and the best interests
of our stockholders to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a certificate of amendment effectuating the Reverse
Stock Split has not been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware by the close of business on July 1, 2020, our
Board will abandon the Reverse Stock Split.</P>

as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a stockholder generally will not recognize gain
or loss on the reverse stock split, except to the extent of cash, if any, received in lieu of a fractional share interest in the
post-reverse stock split shares. The aggregate tax basis of the post-split shares received will be equal to the aggregate tax basis
of the pre-split shares exchanged therefore (excluding any portion of the holder&rsquo;s basis allocated to fractional shares),
and the holding period of the post-split shares received will include the holding period of the pre-split shares exchanged. A holder
of the pre-split shares who receives cash will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the portion of
the tax basis of the pre-split shares allocated to the fractional share interest and the cash received. Such gain or loss will
be a capital gain or loss and will be short term if the pre-split shares were held for one year or less and long term if held more
than one year. No gain or loss will be recognized by us as a result of the reverse stock split.</P>

into a four-year employment agreement with Henry Nisser to serve as General Counsel and Executive Vice President of the Company
and its subsidiaries, as subsequently amended (the &ldquo;<B>Nisser Employment Agreement</B>&rdquo;). For his services, Mr. Nisser
will be paid a salary of $200,000 per annum subject to such further upward adjustments as shall be determined annually by the Board

Mr. Nisser became entitled to a signing bonus in the amount of $50,000, with $25,000 being payable upon May 1, 2019 (the &ldquo;<B>Effective

shares shall vest fifty percent upon the effective date of the Nisser Employment Agreement, with the remainder vesting ratably
over 48 months beginning on June 1, 2019, and (B) an option to purchase 750,000 shares of common stock at a per share exercise
price equal to the closing market price on the effective date, or $0.22 per share, which option has a term of seven (7) years.</P>

the termination or non-renewal of Mr. Nisser&rsquo;s employment, the Company shall pay to Mr. Nisser a &ldquo;<B>Separation Payment</B>&rdquo;
as follows: (A) an amount equal to four weeks of base salary for each full year of service and (B) commencing on the date that
shall be one (1) year from the Effective Date should Mr. Nisser provide the Company with a separation, waiver and release agreement
within 30 days of termination, then the Company shall: (i) an amount equal to the lesser of what the Executive would have received
if the Employment Period ended after (1) the expiration of the remaining portion of the four-year term or the then applicable Renewal
Term (as defined in the Nisser Employment Agreement), as the case may be, or (2) the 18-month period commencing on the date Mr.
Nisser is terminated (in either case, the &ldquo;<B>Separation Period</B>&rdquo;) payable in one lump sum; (ii) provide during
the Separation Period the same medical, dental, long-term disability and life insurance; and (iii) pay an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the maximum annual bonus as Mr. Nisser would have been otherwise entitled to receive by (y) the fraction
in which the numerator is the number of calendar months worked including the entire month in which severance occurred and the denominator
of which is 12; and (iv) all outstanding options and other equity awards shall immediately vest and become fully exercisable for
a period of 24 months. Finally, upon the occurrence of a change in control, Mr. Nisser will be paid an amount equal to four times

on the issuance of shares pursuant to the Nisser Employment Agreement (and provided the Company has sufficient authorized shares

outstanding as of the Record Date, such shares would represent 2.6% of our total outstanding shares (giving effect to such issuance).
The issuance of such shares may result in significant dilution to our stockholders, and afford them a smaller percentage interest
in the voting power, liquidation value and aggregate book value of the Company. The sale or any resale of the Common Stock issued

compensation. The Board further believes that equity incentives motivate high levels of performance, align the interests of our
employees and stockholders by giving directors, employees and consultants the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the
Company, and provide an effective means of recognizing their contributions to the success of the Company. The Board and management
believe that the ability to grant equity incentives will be important to the future success of the Company and is in the best interests

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">The 2018 Plan
includes a variety of forms of awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units
and dividend equivalents to allow the Company to adapt its incentive program to meet the needs of the Company in the changing business
environment in which the Company operates. As of the Record Date, we had 500,000 shares remaining available for future awards under
the 2018 Plan, of which 500,000 shares remained available for future grants of full value awards.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We are requesting an additional 6,500,000
shares pursuant to the Stock Plan Amendment, which will permit the Company to grant awards under the 2018 Plan beyond the date
when the currently authorized shares have been exhausted. The share pool and all share limits under the 2018 Plan have been adjusted,
in accordance with the terms of the 2018 Plan, to reflect the one-for-twenty reverse stock split effected by the Company on March
14, 2019.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">One of the requirements of &ldquo;performance-based
compensation&rdquo; under Section 162(m) is that the material terms of performance-based awards be approved by stockholders. The
material terms include: (i)&nbsp;the employees eligible to receive compensation, (ii) a description of the business criteria upon
which a performance goal may be based, and (iii) the maximum amount of compensation that can be paid to an employee under awards
intended to satisfy the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m). Stockholder approval of the 2018 Plan is
intended to constitute approval of each of these aspects of the 2018 Plan for purposes of the approval requirements of Section
162(m). However, nothing in this proposal precludes the Company or the Compensation Committee, which administers the 2018 Plan,
from granting awards that do not qualify for tax deductibility under Section 162(m), nor is there any guarantee that awards intended
to qualify for tax deductibility under Section 162(m) will ultimately be viewed as so qualifying by the Internal Revenue Service.
If stockholders fail to reapprove the material terms of performance-based awards under the 2018 Plan, we may continue to pay performance-based
compensation thereunder in the future, even though any such compensation paid may not meet the conditions for tax deductibility
under Section 162(m).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">The potential
dilution resulting from issuing all of the proposed 6,500,000 shares under the 2018 Plan, assuming the Stock Plan Amendment is
approved by the stockholders, would be 14.7% on a fully diluted basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><I>The following
is a brief description of the material United&nbsp;States federal income tax consequences associated with awards under the Amended
and Restated 2018 Plan. It is based on existing United&nbsp;States laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that those
laws and regulations will not change in the future. Tax consequences in other countries may vary. This information is not intended
as tax advice to anyone, including participants in the Amended and Restated 2018 Plan.</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><I>Stock Options</I>.
Neither incentive stock option grants nor non-qualified stock option grants cause any tax consequences to the participant or the
Company at the time of grant. Upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the excess of the market value of the shares acquired
over their exercise price is ordinary income to the participant and is deductible by the Company. The participant&rsquo;s tax basis
for the shares is the market value thereof at the time of exercise. Any gain or loss realized upon a subsequent disposition of
the stock will generally constitute capital gain, in connection with which the Company will not be entitled to a tax deduction.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">Upon the exercise
of an incentive stock option, the participant will not realize taxable income, but the excess of the fair market value of the stock
over the exercise price may give rise to alternative minimum tax. When the stock acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option
is subsequently sold, the participant will recognize income equal to the difference between the sales price and the exercise price
of the option. If the sale occurs after the expiration of two years from the grant date and one year from the exercise date, the
income will constitute long-term capital gain. If the sale occurs prior to that time, the participant will recognize ordinary income
to the extent of the lesser of the gain realized upon the sale or the difference between the fair market value of the acquired
stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price; any additional gain will constitute capital gain. The Company will be entitled
to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, but no deduction in connection&nbsp;with
any capital gain recognized by the participant. If the participant exercises an incentive stock option more than three months after
his or her termination of employment due to retirement or other separation other than death or disability, or more than twelve
months after his or her termination of employment due to death or permanent disability, he or she is deemed to have exercised a
non-qualified stock option.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><I>Stock Appreciation
Rights</I>. A participant granted a stock appreciation right under the Amended and Restated 2018 Plan will not recognize income,
and the Company will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time the award is granted. When the participant exercises the stock
appreciation right, the amount of cash and the fair market value of any shares of stock or other consideration received will be
ordinary income to the participant and the Company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time. Compensation
realized by the participant on the exercise of the stock appreciation right should qualify as performance-based compensation under
the Code and thus not be subject to the $1,000,000 deductibility limit of Code Section&nbsp;162(m).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><I>Restricted
Stock</I>. Restricted stock is not taxable to a participant at the time of grant, but instead is included in ordinary income (at
its then fair market value) when the restrictions lapse. A participant may elect, however, to recognize income at the time of grant,
in which case the fair market value of the restricted shares at the time of grant is included in ordinary income and there is no
further income recognition when the restrictions lapse. If a participant makes such an election&nbsp;and thereafter forfeits the
restricted shares, he or she will be entitled to no tax deduction, capital loss or other tax benefit. The Company is entitled to
a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, subject to any applicable limitations
under Code Section&nbsp;162(m).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">A participant&rsquo;s
tax basis for restricted shares will be equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant. The participant will
recognize capital gain (or loss) on a sale of the restricted stock if the sale price exceeds (or is lower than) such basis. The
holding period for restricted shares for purposes of characterizing gain or loss on the sale of any shares as long- or short-term
commences at the time the participant recognizes ordinary income pursuant to an award. The Company is not entitled to a tax deduction
corresponding to any capital gain or loss of the participant.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><I>Restricted
Stock Units</I>. A participant will not recognize income, and the Company will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time a restricted
stock unit award is granted. Upon receipt of shares of stock (or the equivalent value in cash or any combination of cash and the
Company Common Stock) in settlement of a restricted stock unit award, a participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the
fair market value of the stock and cash received as of that date (less any amount he or she paid for the stock and cash), and the
Company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time, subject to any applicable limitations under
Code Section&nbsp;162(m).</P>

award is granted (for example, when the performance goals are established). Upon receipt of stock or cash (or a combination thereof)
in settlement of a performance award, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock

imposition of additional taxes and penalties. All awards that comply with the terms of the Amended and Restated 2018 Plan, however,

federal, state and local taxes (including employment taxes) required by law to be withheld with respect to any exercise, lapse
of restriction or other taxable event arising as a result of the Amended and Restated 2018 Plan. The Compensation Committee may,
at the time the award is granted or thereafter, require or permit that any such withholding requirement be satisfied, in whole
or in part, by delivery of, or withholding from the award, shares having a fair market value on the date of withholding equal to
the amount required to be withheld for tax purposes.</P>

part, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, vest immediately upon the filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K with the
SEC that shows that the Company&rsquo;s revenues for the applicable fiscal year reached or exceeded $100,000,000; notwithstanding
the foregoing, before the Company accelerates any such vesting, the Company&rsquo;s Compensation Committee must prior thereto have

be eligible to receive a performance-based award (the &ldquo;<B>CEO Performance Award</B>&rdquo;), provided that the Company, for
any given fiscal year during the term of this Agreement, meets the following criteria: (A) an increase in revenue, as calculated
under GAAP over the previous fiscal year as reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or successor form for such fiscal year;
provided that any increase less than thirty-five percent (35%) (the &ldquo;<B>Revenue Percentage</B>&rdquo;) shall reduce the CEO
Performance Award correspondingly; (B) positive net income, as calculated under GAAP, as reported in the Annual Report on Form
10-K or successor form for such fiscal year, provided that any increase less than five percent (5%) (the &ldquo;<B>Net Income Percentage</B>&rdquo;)
shall reduce the CEO Performance Award correspondingly; and (C) positive net cash flow from operations on a year-to-year basis,
where cash flow is defined as the net amount of cash and cash-equivalents being transferred into and out of the Company. The CEO
Performance Award shall consist of a number of shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock having a maximum value equal to ten percent
(10%) of any appreciation in the Company&rsquo;s Market Capitalization (as defined in the Ault Employment Agreement) above the
High Water Mark (as defined in the Ault Employment Agreement) as measured by the daily average closing bid price of the Company&rsquo;s
common stock for the applicable fiscal year subject to proration obtained by the product of Revenue Percentage and the Net Income
Percentage. If the CEO Performance Award in a fiscal year is less than ten percent (10%) due to a reduction caused by an annual
shortfall in either the Revenue Percentage or the Net Income Percentage, the prior year&rsquo;s targets would be deemed to have
been achieved if a corresponding overage in a subsequent fiscal year results in the achievement of the cumulative targets. The
annual and cumulative targets for revenue and net income, which are provided solely for the purpose of establishing cumulative
totals, are set forth in the Ault Employment Agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The purpose of the Plans is to advance

savings and retirement plan, or 401(k) plan, which generally covers all of our full-time employees. Pursuant to the 401(k) plan,
eligible employees may make voluntary contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The 401(k) plan
permits, but does not require, matching contributions by the Company on behalf of plan participants. We match contributions at
the rate of (1) $1.00 for each $1.00 contributed, up to 3% of the base salary and (2) $0.50 for each $1.00 contributed thereafter,
up to 5% of the base salary. We are also permitted under the plan to make discretionary contributions. The 401(k) plan is intended
to qualify under Sections 401(k) and 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to such a qualified
plan are deductible by the Company when made, and neither the contributions nor the income earned on those contributions is taxable
to plan participants until withdrawn. All 401(k) plan contributions are credited to separate accounts maintained in trust.<B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our strategy to increase
revenues through acquisitions was developed after a review of our current business. While we continue to maintain our core business
of power system solutions for the military/aerospace, medical and industrial-telecommunication industries, we have determined that
significant organic growth in these industries will be challenging due to our limited releases of new products offerings, insufficient
sales and marketing force as a result of deferring research and development of new products because of limited working capital,
and lack of financial size in industries traditionally dominated by more large, well established and capitalized power system solution
companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Therefore, we believe
that the best strategy for us and our stockholders is to invest in our core business to support releases of advanced new power
technologies and to expand our customer base and market share in our major markets. To support the organic growth, we have hired
a number of additional personnel and are investing to enhance our product offerings with state of the art technology. While we
implement our new organic growth strategy, we are focusing on finding and acquiring companies that have developed new technology
but have been unable to exploit the technology because the lack of capital; companies that are run inefficiently due to the lack
of experience or mismanagement; companies that can benefit from our expertise in the commercial and defense industries or companies
that enhance our overall revenues. Further, as discussed below, we have made an investment in Avalanche which acquired the rights
to a cost effective and environmentally friendly material synthesis technology for textile applications.</P>

strategy of revenue growth through acquisitions, we have hired a number of additional personnel and consultants to assist in identifying,
analyzing, negotiating and acquiring potential companies and we will need to raise a substantial amount of capital for acquisitions
and for supporting our infrastructure. We may invest in and continue to invest in companies that may experience losses until they
can be integrated with our operations or until our cost reduction and efficiency changes can be implemented. Because of our increase
in infrastructure expenses and investing in companies that demonstrate revenue potential but are initially incurring losses, we
anticipate continuing to experience losses in the near future until revenues from these acquisitions exceed our expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Led by our Chairman
and CEO, Milton &ldquo;Todd&rdquo; Ault III, we seek to find undervalued companies and disruptive technologies with a global impact.
We also use a traditional methodology for valuing stocks that primarily looks for deeply depressed prices. Upon making an investment,
we often become actively involved in the companies we seek to acquire. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from
influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve stockholder value, to acquiring a controlling interest or outright
ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating
and expanding that business. Mr. Ault relies heavily on Mr. William B. Horne, the Company&rsquo;s Vice Chairman and CFO, to provide
analysis and guidance on all acquisition targets and throughout the acquisition process.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">During the next several
years, we see a favorable opportunity to follow an activist strategy that centers on the purchase of target stock and the subsequent
removal of any barriers that might interfere with a friendly purchase offer from a strong buyer. Alternatively, in appropriate
circumstances, we or our subsidiaries may become the buyer of target companies, adding them to our portfolio of operating subsidiaries,
thereby expanding our operations through such opportunistic acquisitions. We believe that the companies that we target for our
activist activities are undervalued for many reasons, often including inexperienced management. Unfortunately for the individual
investor, in particular, and the economy, in general, many poor management teams are often unaccountable and very difficult to
remove.</P>

products superior or comparable in quality to ours. Many of our competitors, including Bel Fuse, Artesyn Embedded Technologies,
TDK-Lambda, Delta Electronics, Murata and Mean-Well Power Supplies, have substantially greater fiscal and marketing resources and
geographic presence than we do. If we are successful in increasing our revenues, competitors may notice and increase competition
efforts with our customers.&nbsp;We also face competition from current and prospective customers who may decide to internally design
and manufacture power supplies needed for their products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, certain larger OEMs tend to contract only with
larger power supply manufacturers.</P>

current economic situation, that additional competitors may enter into strategic alliances or even acquisitions. Competition could
thus become more problematic if consolidation trends in the electronics industry continue and some of the OEMs to which we sell
our products are acquired by larger OEMs. To remain competitive, we must continue to compete favorably on the basis of value by
providing reliable manufacturing, offering customer-driven engineering services including custom design and manufacturing, continuously
improving quality and reliability levels, and offering flexible and reliable delivery schedules.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We believe that our
power system solutions and advanced technology is superior to our competitors&rsquo; power supplies mainly because they use the
latest power technology processing and controls which make these power supplies highly customized and efficient. The power-to-volume
ratio, makes our power solutions more compact compared to what is offered by our competitors and is suitable in custom infrastructures
to meet our customers&rsquo; requirements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Another advantage of
our power system solutions product line is based on the &ldquo;Flexible&rdquo; series that employs adjustable power range and a
selectable number of output product design platforms. We believe we have a competitive position with our targeted customers that
need a high-quality, compact product, which can be readily modified to meet the customer&rsquo;s unique requirements.&nbsp;We have
designed the base model power system platform so that it can be quickly and economically modified and adapted to the specific power
needs of any hosting platform or OEM. This &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; approach has allowed us to provide samples of modified power
systems to OEM customers only a few days after initial consultation, an important capability given the emphasis placed by OEMs
on &ldquo;time to market.&rdquo; It also results in very low non-recurring engineering (&ldquo;<B>NRE</B>&rdquo;) expenses. Because
of reduced NRE expenses, we do not generally charge our OEM customers for NRE related to tailoring a power system to a customer&rsquo;s
specific requirements. We believe this gives us an advantage over our competitors, many of which charge their customers for NRE
expenses.</P>

we are not dependent on any one supplier.&nbsp;&nbsp;We generally allow our subcontractors to purchase components based on orders
received or forecasts to minimize our risk of unusable inventory. To the extent necessary, we may allow them to procure materials
prior to orders received to obtain shorter lead times and to achieve quantity discounts following a risk assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;In

each of the following risk factors and any other information set forth in this Annual Report and the other reports filed by the
Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;), including the Company&rsquo;s financial statements
and related notes, in evaluating the Company&rsquo;s business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have historically
experienced operating and net losses and anticipate continuing to experience such losses in the future. For the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017, we had an operating loss of $19,605,456 and $5,983,045 and net losses of $32,982,201 and $10,895,049, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a working capital deficiency of $18,445,302 and $2,234,695, respectively. There are no
assurances that we will be able to achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain
additional financing through private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital
requirements. To the extent that funds generated from any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient,
we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if
available, will be on acceptable terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
If adequate working capital is not available we may be forced to discontinue operations, which would cause investors to lose their
entire investment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">We
expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and need to raise additional capital to continue business development
initiatives and to support our working capital requirements. For example, in March 2017, we were awarded a 3-year, $50 million
purchase order by MTIX Ltd. (&ldquo;MTIX&rdquo;) to manufacture, install and service the Multiplex Laser Surface Enhancement (&ldquo;MLSE&rdquo;)
plasma-laser system. We believe that the MLSE purchase order will be a source of revenue and generate significant cash flows for
us. However, if we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to curtail operations and take additional measures
to reduce costs, including reducing our workforce, eliminating outside consultants and reducing legal fees in order to conserve
cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. As a result of these financing uncertainties, during
the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized that our dependence on ongoing capital requirements to fund our operations raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ongoing capital requirements have only increased since
then, meaning that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern remains and will likely do so for the foreseeable
future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">Until
we are profitable, we will need to quickly raise additional capital in order to fund our operations in furtherance of our business
plan. The proposed financing may include shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common
stock or preferred stock, debt securities, units consisting of the foregoing securities, equity investments from strategic development
partners or some combination of each. Any additional equity financings may be financially dilutive to, and will be dilutive from
an ownership perspective to our stockholders, and such dilution may be significant based upon the size of such financing. Additionally,
we cannot assure that such funding will be available on a timely basis, in needed quantities, or on terms favorable to us, if at
all.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Although our executive
officers have been engaged in the industries in which we operate for varying degrees of time, we did not begin operations of our
current business until recently. We have a very limited operating history in our current form, which makes it difficult to evaluate
our business on the basis of historical operations. As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to forecast our future
results based upon our historical data. Reliance on our historical results may not be representative of the results we will achieve,
and for certain areas in which we operate, principally those unrelated to defense contracting, will not be indicative at all. Because
of the uncertainties related to our lack of historical operations, we may be hindered in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt
to increases or decreases in sales, product costs or expenses. If we make poor budgetary decisions as a result of unreliable historical
data, we could be less profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our stock price.</P>

has evolved in the past and continues to do so. In prior years we have added additional types of services and product offerings
and in some cases we have modified or discontinued those offerings. We intend to continue to try to offer additional types of products
or services, and we do not know whether any of them will be successful. From time to time we have also modified aspects of our
business model relating to our product mix. We do not know whether these or any other modifications will be successful. The additions
and modifications to our business have increased the complexity of our business and placed significant strain on our management,
personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.
Future additions to or modifications of our business are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new business or website we
launch that is not favorably received by the market could damage our reputation or our brand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have given our subsidiary
companies and their executives a certain degree of independence in decision-making. On the one hand, this independence may increase

financial statements included in this Annual Report, our independent auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is an issue raised as a result of ongoing operating losses and a
lack of financing commitments then in place to meet expected cash requirements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is subject
to our ability to generate a profit and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources, including obtaining additional funding
from the sale of our securities, increasing sales or obtaining loans and grants from various financial institutions where possible.
If we do not continue as a going concern, investors will lose their entire investment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">Our
growth strategy through acquisitions is fraught with risk. On June 2, 2017, we acquired a majority interest in Microphase and on
May 23, 2018 we acquired Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (&ldquo;<B>Enertec</B>&rdquo;). Our strategy and business plan is dependent
on our ability to successfully integrate Microphase&rsquo;s, Enertec&rsquo;s and our other acquisition&rsquo;s operations. In addition,
while we are based in Newport Beach, CA, Microphase&rsquo;s operations are located in Shelton, Connecticut, Enertec&rsquo;s operations
are located in Karmiel, Israel and DP Limited&rsquo;s (doing business as Gresham Power Electronics) operations are located in Salisbury,
England. These distant locations and others that we may become involved with in the future will stretch our resources and management
time. Further, failure to quickly and adequately integrate all of these operations and personnel could adversely affect our combined
business and our ability to achieve our objectives and strategy. No assurance can be given that we will realize synergies in the
areas we currently operate.</P>

make additional acquisitions beyond Microphase and Enertec.&nbsp;Whenever we make acquisitions, we could have difficulty integrating
the acquired companies&rsquo; personnel and operations with our own. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may
not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are
successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees
and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks,
including, without limitation, the following:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our operating results
have in the past been subject to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, and we expect that these fluctuations will continue, and may
increase in magnitude, in future periods. Demand for our products is driven by many factors, including the availability of funding
for our products in our customers&rsquo; capital budgets. There is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near
the end of a quarter or fiscal year, in part to spend remaining available capital budget funds. Seasonal fluctuations in customer
demand for our products driven by budgetary and other concerns can create corresponding fluctuations in period-to-period revenues,
and we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenues in any future period.
In addition, the number and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales, where applicable,
have been difficult for us to predict, and large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those
we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our
operating results for such quarter. It is possible that, in some quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations
of public market analysts or investors. In such events, or in the event adverse conditions prevail, the market price of our common
stock may decline significantly.</P>

asset mining, the output of which is cryptocurrencies, which the Commission has indicated it deems a security. In the event that
the digital assets held by us exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash, we inadvertently become an investment company.
An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under
the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company
a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding
50% of the issuer&rsquo;s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns
or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer&rsquo;s total assets (exclusive
of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We are putting in place policies that we expect will work
to keep the investment securities held by us at less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our
cash, liquidating our investment securities or seeking a no-action letter from the Commission if we are unable to acquire sufficient
assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">As Rule 3a-2 is available
to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us, we would have to keep within
the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to make
certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we
do not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.</P>

register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming
and restrictive and would require a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we
could do as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management,
operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment
Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in our incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure
to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.</P>

Unless a substantial part of our assets consists of, and a substantial part of our income is derived from, interests in majority-owned

with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations.&nbsp; If we were forced to comply with
the rules and regulations of the Investment Company Act, our operations would significantly change, and we would be prevented from
successfully executing our business strategy.&nbsp; To avoid regulation under the Investment Company Act and related rules promulgated
by the Commission, we could need to sell bitcoin and other assets which we would otherwise want to retain and could be unable to
sell assets which we would otherwise want to sell.&nbsp; In addition, we could be forced to acquire additional, or retain existing,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Securitization of our assets subjects us to various risks</B>.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We may securitize assets
to generate cash for funding new investments. We refer to the term securitize to describe a form of leverage under which a company
(sometimes referred to as an &ldquo;originator&rdquo; or &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo;) transfers income producing assets to a single-purpose,
bankruptcy-remote subsidiary (also referred to as a &ldquo;special purpose entity&rdquo; or &ldquo;SPE&rdquo;), which is established
solely for the purpose of holding such assets and entering into a structured finance transaction. The SPE would then issue notes
secured by such assets. The special purpose entity may issue the notes in the capital markets either publicly or privately to a
variety of investors, including banks, non-bank financial institutions and other investors. There may be a single class of notes
or multiple classes of notes, the most senior of which carries less credit risk and the most junior of which may carry substantially
the same credit risk as the equity of the SPE.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">An important aspect
of most debt securitization transactions is that the sale and/or contribution of assets into the SPE be considered a true sale
and/or contribution for accounting purposes and that a reviewing court would not consolidate the SPE with the operations of the
originator in the event of the originator's bankruptcy based on equitable principles. Viewed as a whole, a debt securitization
seeks to lower risk to the note purchasers by isolating the assets collateralizing the securitization in an SPE that is not subject
to the credit and bankruptcy risks of the originator. As a result of this perceived reduction of risk, debt securitization transactions
frequently achieve lower overall leverage costs for originators as compared to traditional secured lending transactions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In accordance with
the above description, to securitize loans, we may create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of our assets to such
subsidiary. The SPE may be funded with, among other things, whole loans or interests from other pools and such loans may or may
not be rated. The SPE would then sell its notes to purchasers whom we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate
and the absence of any recourse against us to invest in a pool of income producing assets to which none of our creditors would
have access. We would retain all or a portion of the equity in the SPE. An inability to successfully securitize portions of our
portfolio or otherwise leverage our portfolio through secured and unsecured borrowings could limit our ability to grow our business
and fully execute our business strategy, and could decrease our earnings, if any. However, the successful securitization of portions
of our portfolio exposes us to a risk of loss for the equity we retain in the SPE and might expose us to greater risk on our remaining
portfolio because the assets we retain may tend to be those that are riskier and more likely to generate losses. A successful securitization
may also impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities and may include limitations that could
hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments. The Investment Company Act may also impose restrictions on the
structure of any securitizations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Interests we hold in
the SPE, if any, will be subordinated to the other interests issued by the SPE. As such, we will only receive cash distributions
on such interests if the SPE has made all cash interest and other required payments on all other interests it has issued. In addition,
our subordinated interests will likely be unsecured and rank behind all of the secured creditors, known or unknown, of the SPE,
including the holders of the senior interests it has issued. Consequently, to the extent that the value of the SPE's portfolio
of assets has been reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets, or as a result of defaults, the value of the subordinated
interests we retain would be reduced. Securitization imposes on us the same risks as borrowing except that our risk in a securitization
is limited to the amount of subordinated interests we retain, whereas in a borrowing or debt issuance by us directly we would be
at risk for the entire amount of the borrowing or debt issuance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We may also engage
in transactions utilizing SPEs and securitization techniques where the assets sold or contributed to the SPE remain on our balance
sheet for accounting purposes. If, for example, we sell the assets to the SPE with recourse or provide a guarantee or other credit
support to the SPE, its assets will remain on our balance sheet. Consolidation would also generally result if we, in consultation
with the SEC, determine that consolidation would result in a more accurate reflection of our assets, liabilities and results of
operations. In these structures, the risks will be essentially the same as in other securitization transactions but the assets
will remain our assets for purposes of the limitations described above on investing in assets that are not qualifying assets and
the leverage incurred by the SPE will be treated as borrowings incurred by us for purposes of our limitation on the issuance of
senior securities.</P>

may revise tax laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant adverse effect on our business,
including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our international operations, or that
could require costly changes to those operations, or the way in which they are structured.&nbsp; For example, the effective tax
rates for most U.S. companies reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the U.S. is generally taxed at local rates,
which may be much lower than U.S. tax rates.&nbsp; If we expand abroad and there are changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations
that significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase and our profits could be reduced.&nbsp;
If such increases resulted from our status as a U.S. company, those changes could place us at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors
if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.</P>

tax reform legislation known colloquially as the &ldquo;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,&rdquo; among other things, makes significant changes
to the rules applicable to the taxation of corporations, such as changing the corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, modifying
the rules regarding limitations on certain deductions for executive compensation, introducing a capital investment deduction in
certain circumstances, placing certain limitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain
net operating losses, implementing a minimum tax on the &ldquo;global intangible low-taxed income&rdquo; of a &ldquo;United States
stockholder&rdquo; of a &ldquo;controlled foreign corporation,&rdquo; modifying certain rules applicable to United States stockholders
of controlled foreign corporations, imposing a deemed repatriation tax on certain earnings and adding certain anti-base erosion

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Rapid technology changes
in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies and/or distribution platforms our products
must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released. Therefore, we usually start
our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not be able to achieve
these goals, or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our products may be technologically
inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the
original development schedule of our products, then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved, which may
delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research
and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product launch schedule
or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses and adversely affect our operations and financial
condition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Because of the global
economy, many raw material vendors have reduced capacities, closed production lines and, in some cases, even discontinued their
operations. As a result, there is a global shortage of certain electronic or mineral components, which may extend our production
lead-time and our production costs. Some materials are no longer available to support some of our products, thereby requiring us
to search for cross materials or, even worse, redesign some of our products to support currently-available materials. Such redesign
efforts may require certain regulatory and safety agency re-submittals, which may cause further production delays. While we have
initiated actions that we believe will limit our exposure to such problems, the dynamic business conditions in many of our markets
may challenge the solutions that have been put in place, and issues may recur in the future.</P>

our products are manufactured, assembled and tested by third party subcontractors and contract manufacturers located in Asia. While
we have had relationships with many of these third parties in the past, we cannot predict how or whether these relationships will
continue in the future. In addition, changes in management, financial viability, manufacturing demand or capacity, or other factors,
at these third parties could hurt our ability to manufacture our products.</P>

and/or product quality standards may put us at risk with one or more of these customers. Moreover, changes in market conditions
and strategic changes at the direction of our customers may affect their decision to continue to purchase from us. The loss of
one or more of our significant custom power supply solution customers could have a material adverse impact on our revenues, business

cost-reducing initiatives, including those involving our personnel, which may negatively impact quarterly earnings and profitability
as we account for severance and other related costs. In addition, there is the risk that such measures could have long-term adverse
effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products or services, making

reduced demand for our products, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
If the financial condition of one or more of our major customers should deteriorate, or if they have difficulty acquiring investment
capital due to any of these or other factors, a substantial decrease in our revenues would likely result. We are dependent on the

The OEMs serving this industry are pressured for increased product performance and lower product prices. OEMs, in turn, make similar

to significant downward pressure in certain markets for the reasons described above. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or increase
revenues will be dependent on our ability to expand our customer base, to increase unit sales volumes of these products and to
successfully, develop, introduce and sell new products such as custom design and value-added products. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to expand our customer base, increase unit sales volumes of existing products or develop, introduce and/or sell

changes in United States export and import laws that require us to obtain additional export and import licenses or delays in obtaining
export or import licenses currently being sought could cause significant shipment delays and, if such delays are too great, could
result in the cancellation of orders. Any future restrictions or charges imposed by the United States or any other country on our

our cryptocurrency business, which is pursuing a variety of digital currency. We anticipate mining the top ten cryptocurrencies
for our own account. These include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum, along with other currencies that we consider to
be in the top ten by market capitalization. Virtually every state in the U.S. regulates money transmitters and money services businesses.
In some states the licensing requirements and regulations expressly cover companies engaged in digital currency activities; in
other states it is not clear whether or how the existing laws and regulations apply to digital currency activities. Further, U.S.
federal law requires registration of most such businesses with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&ldquo;<B>FinCEN</B>&rdquo;).
These licenses and registrations subject companies to various anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, record-keeping, reporting
and capital and bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory
agencies. Under U.S. federal law, it is a crime for a person, entity or business that is required to be registered with FinCEN
or licensed in any state to fail to do so, even if the person, entity or business was unaware of the licensing requirement. Further,
under U.S. federal law, anyone who owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business is subject to civil and criminal
penalties. The business in which we have invested has represented to us that it has not taken any action that could subject it
to registration with FinCEN or to the licensing requirements in any state and has agreed that it will not do so until it has become
properly licensed in all required states and registered with FinCEN. However, if the business makes an error, even inadvertently,
we could be subject to potential civil and criminal penalties as a result. Any such penalties, or even the allegation of criminal
activities, could have a material adverse effect on us and our business. Further, all of our foreign business activities expose

foreign governments, and self-regulatory agencies. As cryptocurrency has grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve
Board, U.S. Congress, and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the
operations of cryptocurrency networks, cryptocurrency users, and cryptocurrency exchange markets. Local state regulators such as
the California Department of Financial Institutions and the New York State Department of Financial Services have also initiated
examinations of Bitcoins, the Bitcoin Network, and the regulation thereof. Additionally, a U.S. federal magistrate judge in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas has ruled that &ldquo;Bitcoin is a currency or form of money,&rdquo; two
CFTC commissioners publicly expressed a belief that derivatives based on Bitcoins are subject to the same regulation as those based
on commodities, and the IRS released guidance treating cryptocurrency as property that is not currency for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, although there is no indication yet whether other courts or federal or state regulators will follow these asset classifications.
There is a possibility of future regulatory change altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in us or
our ability to continue to operate.</P>

has not formally asserted regulatory authority over cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency networks, or cryptocurrency trading and ownership.
However, in testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry on December 10, 2014, CFTC Chairman
Timothy Massad stated that the CFTC believed it had jurisdiction over derivative instruments such as futures and swaps based on
digital currencies. In 2015, the CFTC found virtual currencies such as Bitcoin to be commodities subject to oversight under its
authority under the Commodity Exchange Act. Since then, the CFTC has taken action against unregistered Bitcoin futures exchanges;
enforced the laws prohibiting wash trading and prearranged trades on a derivatives platform; issued proposed guidance on what is
a derivative market and what is a spot market in the virtual currency context; issued warnings about valuations and volatility
in spot virtual currency markets; and addressed a virtual currency Ponzi scheme. On May 21, 2018, the CFTC issued a joint staff
advisory that gives exchanges and clearinghouses registered with the CFTC guidance for listing virtual currency derivative products.
The advisory provides guidance on certain enhancements when listing a derivative contract based on virtual currency and clarifies
the CFTC staffs&rsquo; priorities and expectations in its review of new virtual currency derivatives to be listed on a designated
contract market or swap execution facility, or to be cleared by a derivatives clearing organization. Further, on September 26,
2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered an order holding that the CFTC has the power to prosecute
fraud involving virtual currency, which order is consistent with certain prior judicial decisions.</P>

SEC issued an investigative report, stating that offers and sales of digital assets by &ldquo;virtual&rdquo;&nbsp;organizations
using distributed ledger or cryptocurrency technology (i.e., Initial Coin Offerings or Token Sales) are subject to the requirements
of the federal securities laws. On June 6, 2018, the Chairman of the SEC clarified the agency&rsquo;s position, stating that while
Bitcoin is a commodity, the SEC does not deem it and similar cryptocurrency coins to be securities, in contrast to initial coin
offerings of tokens do fall within the definition of a security and will be regulated as such. In March of 2019, the SEC announced
that it is it is looking for an &ldquo;attorney advisor&rdquo; to operate as a &ldquo;Crypto Specialist,&rdquo; which many observers
interpret as an indication that SEC is stepping up its efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the SEC has raised concerns
with instances of public companies changing their business models to reflect a focus on cryptocurrency or blockchain technology
and is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise
of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the federal securities laws, particularly in the context
of a securities offering, and in a few instances halted the trading of companies. To the extent that Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoins,
themselves are determined to be a security, commodity future or other regulated asset, or to the extent that a US or foreign government
or quasi-governmental agency exerts regulatory authority over the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin Networks, or cryptocurrency trading

faces an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United States but also in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European
Union, China and Russia. While certain governments such as Germany&mdash;where the Ministry of Finance has declared Bitcoins to
be &ldquo;Rechnungseinheiten&rdquo; (a form of private money that is recognized as a unit of account, but not recognized in the
same manner as fiat currency) &mdash; have issued guidance as to how to treat bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies, most regulatory
bodies have not yet issued official statements regarding intention to regulate or determinations on regulation of cryptocurrency,
the cryptocurrency networks, and cryptocurrency users. Among those for which preliminary guidance has been issued in some form,
Canada and Taiwan have labeled cryptocurrency as a digital or virtual currency, distinct from fiat currency, while Sweden and Norway
are among those to categorize cryptocurrency as a form of virtual asset or commodity. In China, authorities have recently banned
use of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies and ordered Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchanges to cease trading and immediately
notify users of their closures. Similarly, Russia has indicated an intention to ban use of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies
and Russia&rsquo;s Central Bank stated that at this stage they will not approve any cryptocurrency trading on any official exchange,
nor will it approve the use of the technology for infrastructure purposes. In May 2014, the Central Bank of Bolivia banned the
use of Bitcoins as a means of payment. In the summer and fall of 2014, Ecuador announced plans for its own state-backed electronic
money, while passing legislation that reportedly prohibits the use of decentralized digital currencies. Conversely, regulatory
bodies in some countries such as India and Switzerland have declined to exercise regulatory authority when afforded the opportunity.
Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations, or directives that affect cryptocurrency networks
and its users, particularly cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions&rsquo; regulatory
scope. Other countries such as Malaysia and Australia have been considering regulation, classification, and potential bans. Such
laws, regulations, or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of cryptocurrency
by users, merchants, and service providers outside of the United States and may, therefore, impede the growth of the cryptocurrency
economy.</P>

extent to which the value of cryptocurrency mined by a professionalized crypto mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and
operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized crypto mining operation may be more likely to
sell a higher percentage of its newly mined cryptocurrency rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin&mdash;and it may partially
or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage of the
new cryptocurrency mined each day will be sold into the cryptocurrency exchange markets more rapidly, thereby reducing cryptocurrency
prices. Lower cryptocurrency prices will result in further tightening of profit margins, particularly for professionalized crypto
mining operations with higher costs and more limited capital reserves, creating a network effect that may further reduce the price
of cryptocurrency until crypto mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining power from the
cryptocurrency networks. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined cryptocurrency
could result in a reduction in the price of cryptocurrency that could adversely impact Digital Farms, Inc., as well as an investment

is no official developer or group of developers that formally controls the Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin Networks. Any individual
can download the particular cryptocurrency network software and make any desired modifications, which are proposed to users and
miners on the respective network through software downloads and upgrades. A substantial majority of miners and the particular cryptocurrency
users must consent to those software modifications by downloading the altered software or upgrade that implements the changes;
otherwise, the changes do not become a part of the cryptocurrency network. Generally, changes to various cryptocurrency networks
have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners, ensuring that the cryptocurrency networks remain coherent economic
systems; however, a developer or group of developers could potentially propose a modification to a cryptocurrency network that
is not accepted by a vast majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial population of participants
in the respective cryptocurrency network. In such a case, and if the modification is material and/or not backwards compatible with
the prior version of the respective cryptocurrency network software, a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; in the blockchain could develop and two
separate networks of the same cryptocurrency could result, one running the pre-modification software program and the other running
the modified version (e.g., a second bitcoin network). Such a fork in the blockchain typically would be addressed by community-led
efforts to merge the forked blockchains, and several prior forks have been so merged without any material impact on the price of
Bitcoin, although there can be no assurance that this will always be the case upon a fork. This kind of split in a Bitcoin, Ethereum,
or Litecoin Network could materially and adversely impact an investment in us and, in the worst case scenario, harm the sustainability
of the respective network&rsquo;s economy.</P>

a result, professionalized crypto mining operations are of a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined, regular expenses
and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized crypto mining operations to more immediately sell
cryptocurrencies earned from crypto mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual miners in past years were more likely
to hold newly mined bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined bitcoins
and/or other cryptocurrencies greatly increases the supply of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies for sale, creating downward
pressure on the price of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies.</P>

extent to which the value of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies mined by a professionalized crypto mining operation exceeds
the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized crypto mining operation
may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies rapidly if it is operating
at a low profit margin&mdash;and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit
margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially reducing bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies
prices. Lower bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies prices could result in further tightening of profit margins, particularly for
professionalized crypto mining operations with higher costs and more limited capital reserves, creating a network effect that may
further reduce the price of bitcoin until crypto mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining
power. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies
could result in a reduction in the price of bitcoins and/or other cryptocurrencies that could adversely impact business of Digital

to major defense contractors partially as a result of the overall reduction in defense spending and sequestration by the U.S. Congress.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, Microphase has been significantly short of capital needed to acquire parts for production of
its products to complete orders for such products. At times, Microphase has not had the cash available to make advance payments
for the purchase of parts, and then, as a consequence, Microphase would not receive the parts from its vendors required to finish
a customer order. This would then delay the delivery of products to customers, and would also delay recognition of the resulting
revenues and the receipt of cash from the customer. Sometimes after experiencing a delay in delivery of an order from Microphase,
the customer would not place its next order with Microphase, resulting in a loss of business.</P>

dependent on sales to major defense contractors of the U.S. military and its allies, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE Systems
and SAAB. The percentages of its revenue that were derived from sales to these named major defense contractors and directly to
the U.S. Government were 55.6% in fiscal 2018 and 59.0% in fiscal 2017. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration
of Microphase&rsquo;s relationship with any such major defense contractors or the U.S. Government could materially reduce its revenue.&nbsp;
During the year ended December 31, 2018 there were two customers that accounted for more than 10% of sales:&nbsp; BAE Systems,
Saab and Lockheed Martin.&nbsp; During the year ended December 31, 2017 there were two customers that accounted for more than 10%

with the same major defense contractors and the U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the future, and the U.S. Government
may choose to use other contractors. Microphase expects that a majority of the business that it seeks will be awarded through competitive
bidding. Microphase operates in highly competitive markets and its competitors have more extensive or more specialized engineering,
manufacturing and marketing capabilities than Microphase does in many areas, and Microphase may not be able to continue to win
competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the competitive bidding process
involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to Microphase,
as well as the risk that Microphase may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded
to us. Following any contract award, Microphase may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract
rescission as a result of its competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to it in competitive bidding. Major defense
contractors to whom Microphase supplies components for systems must compete with other major defense contractors (to which Microphase
may not supply components) for military orders from the U.S. Government.</P>

Microphase control and have long-term consequences for its business. U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain
and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including until recently sequestration (automatic, across-the-board
U.S. Government budgetary spending cuts), and the purchase of our products could be superseded by alternate arrangements. While
the US defense budget was recently increased, there can be no assurance that this increase will be maintained for the foreseeable
future. A change in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs,
or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on Microphase&rsquo;s future business.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Over its lifetime,
a U.S. Government program awarded to a major defense contractor may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts
and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year contracts
may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year
basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligations over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs
often receive only partial funding initially, and additional funds are designated only as Congress authorizes further appropriations.
The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program with respect to major defense contractors for which Microphase is a subcontractor
would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on its operations.
In addition, the termination of, or failure to commit additional funds to, a program for which Microphase is a subcontractor could
result in lost revenue and increase its overall costs of doing business.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Generally, U.S. Government
contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to Microphase&rsquo;s
contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already
reimbursed must be refunded. Microphase has recorded contract revenues based on costs Microphase expect to realize upon final audit.
However, Microphase does not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and Microphase may be required to materially
reduce its revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination
of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting
or subcontracting for a period of time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, U.S. Government
contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. Government&rsquo;s
convenience upon the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Microphase can give no assurance
that one or more of the U.S. Government contracts with a major defense contractor under which Microphase provides component products
will not be terminated under these circumstances. Also, Microphase can give no assurance that it will be able to procure new contracts
to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of its U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion
of Microphase&rsquo;s revenue is dependent on its performance and payment under its U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one
or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Microphase&rsquo;s
government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, though customary
in U.S. Government contracts, increase its performance and compliance costs. In addition, these costs might increase in the future,
thereby reducing Microphase&rsquo;s margins, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments,
or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of
time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control,
U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording
of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts
would have an adverse impact on Microphase&rsquo;s operations and could have an adverse effect on its standing and eligibility
for future U.S. Government contracts.</P>

defense contractor, Microphase faces certain security threats, including threats to its information technology infrastructure,
attempts to gain access to its proprietary or classified information, threats to physical security, and domestic terrorism events.
Microphase&rsquo;s information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of its business and essential

are persistent, evolve quickly and include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, attempts to access information, denial of

has invested in skilled information technology resources to appropriately identify threats and mitigate potential risks, but there

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Microphase has a number
of fixed-price contracts which allow it to benefit from cost savings but subject it to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly
for firm fixed-price contracts, because Microphase assumes the entire cost burden. If its initial estimates are incorrect, Microphase
can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose Microphase to potentially large losses because the U.S.
Government can hold Microphase responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of its
replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract.
Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications, unforeseen events such as technological difficulties,
fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with its suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price
becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to Microphase. The U.S. and other countries also may experience a significant increase
in inflation. A significant increase in inflation rates could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts.
Furthermore, if Microphase does not meet contract deadlines or specifications, Microphase may need to renegotiate contracts on
less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right
to terminate. In addition, some of its contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if Microphase
fails to meet the terms specified in those contracts Microphase may not realize their full benefits. Microphase&rsquo;s results
of operations are dependent on its ability to maximize its earnings from its contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact
on its financial results.&nbsp;</P>

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab
neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October
2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, which has adversely affected the peace
process and has negatively influenced Israel&rsquo;s relationship with its Arab citizens and several Arab countries, including
the Israel-Gaza conflict. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel&rsquo;s international trade relations and may limit the geographic
markets where Enertec can sell its products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or
curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect Enertec&rsquo;s operations.</P>

predominantly Muslim countries since Israel&rsquo;s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain
Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some
of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved.
Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign

listing requirement, we may be subject to delisting by the NYSE American. In the event our common stock is no longer listed for
trading on the NYSE American, our trading volume and share price may decrease and we may experience further difficulties in raising
capital which could materially affect our operations and financial results.</P>

November 20, 2017, we received a letter from NYSE Regulation indicating that the NYSE American had concluded that we failed to
comply with Section 401(a) of the NYSE American&rsquo;s Company Guide, which section requires that a listed company &ldquo;make
immediate public disclosure of all material information concerning its affairs&rdquo; The letter, which relates to our disclosure
of certain personnel changes to our board of directors and officers, provided that such letter constituted a warning letter issued
to us pursuant to Section 1009(a)(i) of the NYSE American Company Guide. On October 12, 2017, we filed a Form 8-K that disclosed
that certain personnel changes to our board of directors and executive officers were effective October 6, 2017. On November 6,
2017, we filed an amendment to the above referenced Form 8-K that disclosed that the personnel changes had not in fact occurred.
After discussion with the NYSE American, on November 8, 2017, we filed a subsequent Form 8-K that further clarified that we had
determined to rescind the personnel changes as of October 23, 2017. In that Form 8-K, we provided additional disclosure explaining
why the personnel changes were not undertaken.</P>

November 29, 2017, we notified the NYSE American, LLC that we were no longer in compliance with Rule 801(h) of the NYSE American
Company Guide because, as a smaller reporting company, our Board of Directors was not comprised of at least 50% independent directors.
On November 28, 2017, our Board of Directors approved the issuance of cash compensation, and 10,000 shares of common stock and
warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock subject to vesting and stockholder approval, to Mr. William Horne, a director
of our company, for services. As a result of this compensation, Mr. Horne may not be deemed independent within the meaning of Section
803A(2) of the NYSE American Company Guide. Mr. Horne has resigned from the audit committee of the Board of Directors. Robert Smith
has been appointed as chair of the audit committee. On December 8, 2017, our board of directors rescinded the equity compensation
granted to Mr. Horne.&nbsp; We believe that we are therefore presently in compliance with Rule 801(h) of the NYSE American Company
Guide.</P>

January 4, 2019, we received a deficiency letter from NYSE American indicating that we were not in compliance with the continued
listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the &ldquo;<B>Company Guide</B>&rdquo;).
Specifically, the letter informed the Company that the Exchange has determined that the shares of our common stock have been selling
for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and, pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the Company's
continued listing is predicated on the Company effecting a reverse stock split of our common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained
price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the NYSE American determined to be no later than July 4, 2019. As noted
above, on March 18, 2019 we effectuated a reverse split whereby each twenty (20) shares of our common stock were combined into
one such share, which increased the market price to a level where we regained compliance with the Company Guide. However, since
that time our common stock has declined significantly and there can be no assurance that it will not continue to do so. If the
decline is sufficiently marked, we will in all likelihood receive another letter similar to the one referenced above; however,
there can be no assurance that we could in that event successfully conduct another reverse split on a timely basis, if at all,
or that the NYSE Exchange will not take more drastic action, up to and including delisting our shares of common stock from the
exchange.</P>

$11.40 to $46.40 per share and warrants to purchase up to 936,381 shares of common stock, with a weighted average exercise price

violations of state law and breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and gross mismanagement by the individual defendants
as, in the view of the plaintiffs, we had entered into poorly advised loan transactions and related party transactions. We believe
that these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend them. We moved to dismiss the Complaint and on February 25,
2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted plaintiffs leave to amend their Complaint.&nbsp; On March 11, 2019, plaintiffs
filed their amended complaint asserting violations of breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment claims based on the previously
pled transactions. On March 25, 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.&nbsp; The motion to dismiss is returnable
before the Court on May 6, 2019.</P>

2017. The increase in revenue was primarily due to our four acquisitions completed during 2017 and 2018. Revenues generated by
these four acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2018, represented $13,174,615 of our increase in revenues. Excluding
the increase in revenues that were generated by our recent acquisitions, the Company generated revenues of $13,979,604, which represented
an increase of $7,309,882. As discussed below, the increase of $7,309,882 from the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily
due to our cryptocurrency mining operations and on revenues generated from a related-party from the manufacture of the Multiplex
Laser Surface Enhancement (&ldquo;<B>MLSE</B>&rdquo;) plasma-laser system.</P>

to 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 37.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross margins
was partially attributable to the lower margin revenue of $3,907,280 from MTIX, a related party, with gross margins of 21.5% combined
with negative margins of (202.7%) on revenues of $1,675,549 at Digital Farms. The negative gross margins at Digital Farms are attributed
to monthly recurring fixed costs at our colocation facilities which temporarily exceed the revenues from our mining operations
while we place our miners in service. If we had not recognized revenue, and the related cost of revenue, from Digital Farms and
our contract with MTIX, then our adjusted gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been 36.8%. The decrease
in gross margins from 37.8% to 36.8% is mainly attributable to an increase in costs of our commercial products sold in our U.S.
operations, which historically have had much greater gross margins, offset by higher gross margins related to restaurant operations.</P>

of Microphase and Enertec occurred on June 2, 2017 and May 23, 2018, respectively. Enertec incurred engineering and product development
expenses for the period May 23, 2018 to December 31, 2018 of $135,964. During the prior-year period, Microphase reported $293,775
in engineering and product development expenses as opposed to $466,575 during the year ended December 31, 2018. In aggregate, these
acquisitions resulted an increase in engineering and product development expenses of $308,764.</P>

and marketing expenses. The remaining increase of $177,753 is attributed to an increase in personnel costs directly attributed
to sales and marketing personnel at our U.S. and UK based operations. Throughout the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we augmented
our sales and marketing team in the U.S. with the addition of a Vice President of Business Development and two regional sales managers.
The increase in selling and marketing expenses is partially attributed to the increase in salaries and benefits and travel related
costs for these three new sales and marketing positions. Further, during December 2017, we hired a Sales Director at our UK operations.</P>

administrative expenses. The adjusted increase of $8,921,016 from the comparative prior period was mainly due to higher stock-based
compensation expenses, an increase in legal and audit costs, an increase in investor relationship costs and hiring of additional
consultants to build an infrastructure in anticipation of our future growth and the increase in cost attributed to the hiring of
a new chief financial officer. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses is due to various costs, none of which
are significant individually.</P>

$13,453,344 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $4,990,397 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest
expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily related to the amortization of debt discount, in the aggregate amount
of $11,191,056 resulting from original issue discount on the issuance of warrants in conjunction with the sale of debt instruments
in the aggregate amount of $25,443,760. During the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of these issuances, non-cash interest
expense of $11,191,056 was recorded from the amortization of debt discount and debt financing costs. The remaining increase in
interest expense was due to an increase in the amount of the Company&rsquo;s total borrowings and which was primarily offset by
interest income and the accretion of original issue discount pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement entered into on September
6, 2017, between the Company and AVLP (&ldquo;AVLP Loan Agreement&rdquo;) of $2,034,358.</P>

for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange

of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.</P>

of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>

June 17, 2018, the Company entered into a ten year executive employment agreement with Milton C. Ault, III, to serve as Chief Executive
Officer of the Company.&nbsp; For his services, Mr. Ault will be paid a base salary of $400,000 per annum (the &ldquo;Base Salary&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; background-color: white">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; background-color: white">Pursuant
to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement, if the Company meets or exceeds criteria adopted by the
Company&rsquo;s compensation committee (the &ldquo;Compensation Committee&rdquo;) for earning bonuses which shall be adopted by
the Compensation Committee annually, Mr. Ault shall be eligible to receive an annual bonus, which percentage shall be based on
achievement of applicable performance goals determined by the Compensation Committee.</P>

Mr. Ault is entitled to receive equity participation as follows: (A) a grant of restricted stock in the aggregate amount of 50,000
shares of common stock, which shares shall vest ratably over 48 months beginning on January 1, 2020, provided, however, that such
shares may, in whole or in part, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, vest immediately upon the filing of an Annual
Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;)&nbsp; that shows that the Company&rsquo;s
revenues for the applicable fiscal year reached or exceeded $100,000,000; notwithstanding the foregoing, before the Company accelerates
any such vesting, the Company&rsquo;s Compensation Committee must prior thereto have obtained the consent of Mr. Ault, which consent
may be withheld in his discretion, and (B) an option to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share price
equal to $16.00, which option will vest over 60 months.</P>

addition, Mr. Ault shall be eligible to receive a performance-based award (the &ldquo;CEO Performance Award&rdquo;), provided that
the Company, for any given fiscal year during the term of this agreement, meets the following criteria: (A) an increase in revenue,
as calculated under GAAP over the previous fiscal year as reported in the Annual Report on Form 10-K or successor form for such
fiscal year; provided that any increase less than thirty-five percent (35%) (the &ldquo;Revenue Percentage&rdquo;) shall reduce
the CEO Performance Award correspondingly; (B) positive net income, as calculated under GAAP, as reported in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K or successor form for such fiscal year, provided that any increase less than five percent (5%) (the &ldquo;Net Income
Percentage&rdquo;) shall reduce the CEO Performance Award correspondingly; and (C) positive net cash flow from operations on a
year-to-year basis, where cash flow is defined as the net amount of cash and cash-equivalents being transferred into and out of
the Company. The CEO Performance Award shall consist of a number of shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock having a maximum
value equal to ten percent (10%) of any appreciation in the Company&rsquo;s Market Capitalization above the High Water Mark (as
such terms are defined in the agreement) as measured by the daily average closing bid price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock
for the applicable fiscal year subject to proration obtained by the product of Revenue Percentage and the Net Income Percentage.
If the CEO Performance Award in a fiscal year is less than ten percent (10%) due to a reduction caused by an annual shortfall in
either the Revenue Percentage or the Net Income Percentage, the prior year&rsquo;s targets would be deemed to have been achieved
if a corresponding overage in a subsequent fiscal year results in the achievement of the cumulative targets.&nbsp; The annual and
cumulative targets for revenue and net income, which are provided solely for the purpose of establishing cumulative totals, are
set forth in the agreement.</P>

a &ldquo;Separation Payment&rdquo; as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;an amount equal to four (4) weeks of base salary for
each full year of service and credit for his service commencing from September 22, 2016, (B) should Mr. Ault provide the Company
with a separation, waiver and release agreement&nbsp; within 60 days of termination, then the Company shall: (i) pay his base

for cancellation of (i) an outstanding loan made by the Holder to MTIX in the amount of $265,766; and (ii) cancellation of an aggregate
of $2,002,000 owed by MTIX to the Holder pursuant to an Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of a Textile Multi-Laser Enhancement

issuance. Note B is convertible into the Company&rsquo;s common stock at a conversion price of $0.85 per share, does not bear interest,
and matures two years from issuance. However,&nbsp;the Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of Note B, following
receipt by the Holder of an aggregate of $2,267,766 of gross proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion
of Note A or Note B.</P>

$2,267,766 obligation. As a result of entering into the exchange agreement with the Holder, MTIX is obligated to pay the Company
$2,668,266, consisting of the amount of the exchange agreement of $2,267,766 and a value added tax of $400,500 from the sale of

balance sheets of DPW Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity and cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;).&nbsp;
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

and 20 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report
has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd., is based
solely on the report of the other auditors.</P>

its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures

by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern. <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt">As
of December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $902,329, an accumulated deficit of $55,721,115 and a negative
working capital of $18,445,302. The Company has incurred recurring losses and reported losses for the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2017, totaled $32,233,881 and $10,616,231, respectively. In the past, the Company has financed its operations principally
through issuances of convertible debt, promissory notes and equity securities. During 2018, the Company continued to successfully
obtain additional equity and debt financing and in restructuring existing debt.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company expects
to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and needs to raise additional capital to continue its business development
initiatives and to support its working capital requirements. In March 2017, the Company was awarded a 3-year, $50 million purchase
order by MTIX Ltd. (&ldquo;MTIX&rdquo;) to manufacture, install and service the Multiplex Laser Surface Enhancement (&ldquo;MLSE&rdquo;)
plasma-laser system. Currently, the Company has subcontracted out a significant amount of these services to third parties. Management
believes that the MLSE purchase order will be a source of revenue and generate significant cash flows for the Company. Additionally,
on April 2, 2019, the Company received gross proceeds of approximately $7 million in a public offering of its securities (See Note
28). Management believes that the Company has access to capital resources through potential public or private issuances of debt
or equity securities. However, if the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to curtail operations and
take additional measures to reduce costs, including reducing its workforce, eliminating outside consultants and reducing legal
fees to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet its obligations. These matters raise substantial
doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might become necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The preparation of
financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. The Company's
management believes that the estimates, judgments and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time
they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Key estimates include acquisition accounting, fair
value of certain financial instruments, reserve for trade receivables and inventories, carrying amounts of investments, fair value
of digital currencies, accruals of certain liabilities including product warranties, useful lives and depreciation, and deferred
income taxes and related valuation allowance.</P>

revenues from the sale of its products through a direct and indirect sales force.&nbsp;The Company&rsquo;s performance obligations
to deliver products are satisfied at the point in time when products are received by the customer, which is when the customer has
title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership. The Company provides standard assurance warranties, which are not separately
priced, that the products function as intended. The Company primarily receives fixed consideration for sales of product. Some of
the Company&rsquo;s contracts with distributors include stock rotation rights after six months for slow moving inventory, which
represents variable consideration. The Company uses an expected value method to estimate variable consideration and constrains
revenue for estimated stock rotations until it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized
will not occur. To date, returns have been insignificant. The Company&rsquo;s customers generally pay within 30 days from the receipt
of a valid invoice.</P>

manufacturing services in exchange primarily for fixed fees, however, the initial two MLSE units are subject to variable pricing
under the $50 million purchase order from MTIX. Under the terms of the MLSE purchase order, the Company shall be entitled to cost
plus $100,000 for the manufacture of the first two MLSE units. The Company has determined that the costs of manufacturing the MLSE
units will decline over time due to the effects of a learning curve which will result in a great amount of revenue being recognized
for these initial two MLSE units.</P>

which include revenues generated by Enertec and in certain instances revenues generated by DPL, the Company&rsquo;s performance
obligation for manufacturing services is satisfied over time as the Company creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls
as the asset is created or enhanced. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue based upon proportional performance over time using
a cost to cost method which measures progress based on the costs incurred to total expected costs in satisfying its performance
obligation. This method provides a depiction of the progress in providing the manufacturing service because there is a direct relationship
between the costs incurred by the Company and the transfer of the manufacturing service to the customer. Manufacturing services
that are recognized based upon the proportional performance method are included in the above table as services transferred over
time and to the extent the customer has not been invoiced for these revenues, as accrued revenue in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Revisions to the Company&rsquo;s estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are
reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified.</P>

receivables are recorded when billed and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying amount

The Company individually reviews all accounts receivable balances and based upon an assessment of current creditworthiness, estimates
the portion, if any, of the balance that will not be collected. The Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based
on historical collection trends, age of outstanding receivables and existing economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances
indicate that a specific receivable balance may be impaired, further consideration is given to the collectability of those balances
and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. A customer&rsquo;s receivable balance is considered past-due based on its contractual
terms. Past-due receivable balances are written-off when the Company&rsquo;s internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful
in collecting the amount due. Based on an assessment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, of the collectability of invoices, accounts
receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $5,000 and $5,000, respectively.</P>

the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived
asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result

Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the

rates of warranty claims and cost per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability
and adjusts the amounts as necessary. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company&rsquo;s accrued warranty liability was $86,495.</P>

recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in
the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which
the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes
it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income
and Comprehensive Income in the period that includes the enactment date.</P>

whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC
No. 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that
the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.&nbsp;The
tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amount recorded, such
differences impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Interest and penalties, if any, related
to accrued liabilities for potential tax assessments are included in income tax expense. ASC No. 740-10-25&nbsp;also requires management
to evaluate tax positions taken by the Company and recognize a liability if the Company has taken uncertain tax positions that
more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities. Management of the Company has evaluated
tax positions taken by the Company and has concluded that as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there are no uncertain tax positions
taken, or expected to be taken, that would require recognition of a liability that would require disclosure in the financial statements.

common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivative financial instruments as equity if the contracts (i)&nbsp;require

(including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the Company),
(ii)&nbsp;give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement),
or (iii)&nbsp;contain reset provisions as either an asset or a liability. The Company assesses classification of its freestanding
derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between assets and liabilities is required.
The Company determined that certain freestanding derivatives, which principally consist of issuance of warrants to purchase shares
of common stock in connection with convertible notes and to employees of the Company, satisfy the criteria for classification as
equity instruments as these warrants do not contain cash settlement features or variable settlement provision that cause them to
not be indexed to the Company&rsquo;s own stock.</P>

took into consideration general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is above cost, and the Company&rsquo;s
ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future.
As a result of this analysis, the Company has determined that its investment in AVLP&rsquo;s marketable equity securities are valued

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In February 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-02, <I>Leases (Topic 842)</I>, (&ldquo;ASU 2016-02&rdquo;) in order to increase transparency and comparability
among organizations by, among other provisions, recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases
classified as operating leases under previous U.S. GAAP. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018 (including interim periods within those periods) using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption
is permitted.&nbsp; In transition, entities may also elect a package of practical expedients that must be applied in its entirety
to all leases commencing before the adoption date, unless the lease is modified, and permits entities to not reassess (a) the existence
of a lease, (b) lease classification or (c) determination of initial direct costs, as of the adoption date, which effectively allows
entities to carryforward accounting conclusions under previous U.S. GAAP. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, <I>Leases
(Topic 842): Targeted Improvements</I>, which provides entities an optional transition method to apply the guidance under Topic
842 as of the adoption date, rather than as of the earliest period presented.&nbsp; The Company adopted Topic 842 on January 1,
2019, using the optional transition method to apply the new guidance as of January 1, 2019, rather than as of the earliest period
presented, and elected the package of practical expedients described above. The Company expects to recognize additional operating
liabilities of approximately $4.2 million, with corresponding ROU assets of approximately the same amount as of January 1, 2019
based on the present value of the remaining lease payments.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In July 2017, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2017-11, <I>Earnings&nbsp;per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Derivatives
and Hedging (Topic 815)</I> (&ldquo;ASU 2017-11&rdquo;). ASU 2017-11 consists of two parts. The amendments in Part I of this update
change the classification analysis of certain equity-linked financial instruments (or embedded features) with down round features.
When determining whether certain financial instruments should be classified as liabilities or equity instruments, a down round
feature no longer precludes equity classification when assessing whether the instrument is indexed to an entity&rsquo;s own stock.
The amendments also clarify existing disclosure requirements for equity-classified instruments. As a result, a freestanding equity-linked
financial instrument (or embedded conversion option) no longer would be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value as
a result of the existence of a down round feature. For freestanding equity classified financial instruments, the amendments require
entities that present earnings per share (&ldquo;EPS&rdquo;) in accordance with Topic 260 to recognize the effect of the down round
feature when it is triggered. That effect is treated as a dividend and as a reduction of income available to common stockholders
in basic EPS. Convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features are now subject to the specialized
guidance for contingent beneficial conversion features (in Subtopic 470-20, Debt&mdash;Debt with Conversion and Other Options),
including related EPS guidance (in Topic 260). The amendments in Part II of this update re-characterize the indefinite deferral
of certain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification, to a scope exception. Those amendments
do not have an accounting effect. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of this update are effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. For all other entities, the amendments
in Part I of this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an
entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal
year that includes that interim period. The amendments in Part II of this update do not require any transition guidance because
those amendments do not have an accounting effect. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on
its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures but does not expect it to have a material impact.</P>

issued ASU No. 2018-07,&nbsp;<I>Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting</I>, (&ldquo;ASU 2018-07&rdquo;). ASU
2018-07 simplifies the accounting for share-based payments granted to nonemployees for goods and services. Under ASU 2018-07, most
of the guidance on such payments to nonemployees would be aligned with the requirements for share-based payments granted to employees.
The changes take effect for public companies for fiscal years starting after Dec. 15, 2018, including interim periods within that
fiscal year. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than an entity&rsquo;s
adoption date of Topic 606. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial

the Company to purchase up to 13,887,994 shares of AVLP common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share for a period of five
years. The exercise price of $0.50 is subject to adjustment for customary stock splits, stock dividends, combinations or similar
events. The warrant may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded an unrealized
gain (loss) on its investment in warrants of AVLP of ($6,926,293) and $4,512,912 respectively, representing the difference between
the cost basis and the estimated fair value of the warrants in the Company&rsquo;s accumulated other comprehensive income in the
stockholder's equity section of the Company&rsquo;s consolidated balance sheet and as a change in net unrealized gains on securities
available-for-sale in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017, the Company recognized, in other comprehensive income (loss), net unrealized gain (loss) on securities available-for-sale
of ($8,027,746) and $5,171,743, respectively. The Company&rsquo;s investment in warrants and common stock of AVLP represented ($7,357,012)
and $5,062,960, respectively, of the net unrealized gain (loss) on securities available-for-sale. The Company&rsquo;s investment
in AVLP will be revalued on each balance sheet date. The fair value of the Company&rsquo;s holdings in the AVLP warrants was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing method. The risk-free rate, which ranged between 1.92% and 2.98%, was derived from the U.S.
Treasury yield curve, matching the term of our investment, in effect at the measurement date. The volatility factor which ranged
between 68.7% and 80.4% was determined based on historical stock prices for similar technology companies with market capitalizations
under $100 million. The warrant valuation is a Level 3 measurement.</P>

ASC No. 310,&nbsp;<I>Receivables</I>&nbsp;(&ldquo;ASC 310&rdquo;), the Company accounts for its convertible promissory notes in
AVLP at amortized cost, which represents the amount at which the convertible promissory notes were acquired, adjusted for accrued
interest and accretion of original issue discount and discount attributed to the fair value of the 13,887,994 warrants that the
Company received in conjunction with its investment. Interest is accreted using the effective interest method. The Company records
interest on an accrual basis and recognizes it as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the convertible promissory
notes, to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The original issue discount of $165,448 and the discount attributed
to the fair value of the warrants of $4,644,022 are being amortized as interest income through the maturity date. During the years
ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $2,034,358 and $436,346, respectively, of interest income for the discount
accretion. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded contractual interest receivable attributed to
the AVLP Notes and AVLP Loan Agreement of $679,917 and $324,400, respectively.</P>

the collectability of both interest and principal for the convertible promissory notes in AVLP to determine whether there was an
impairment. Based on current information and events, the Company determined that it is probable that it will be able to collect

significant assumptions related to the borrower&rsquo;s credit risk, financial performance, expected sales, and estimated fair
value of the collateral.</P>

business operations in Israel. The Company made $300,000 of payments to the seller of the property and received a 28% undivided
interest in the real property (&ldquo;Property&rdquo;). The Company&rsquo;s subsidiary, Coolisys, entered into a Trust Agreement
and Tenancy In Common Agreement with Roni Kohn, who owns a 72% interest in the Property, the daughter of Mr. Kohn and an Israeli
citizen. The Property was purchased to serve as a residence/office facility for the Company in order to oversee its Israeli operations
and to expand its business in the hi-tech industry located in Israel. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, Ms. Kohn will hold and manage
Coolisys&rsquo; undivided 28% interest in the Property. The trust will be in effect until it is terminated by mutual agreement
of the parties. During the term of the trust, Ms. Kohn will not sell, lease, sublease, transfer, grant, encumber, change or effect
any other disposition with respect to the Property or Coolisys&rsquo; interest without the Company&rsquo;s approval.</P>

The Plans, as amended, provide for the issuance of a maximum of 868,632 shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock. The Company
also has 1,500 outstanding options that were granted between 2009 and 2011 pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2002 Stock Option

the Company also issued 79,153 and 97,440, respectively, shares of common stock to its consultants and service providers pursuant

is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent term approximating the expected life of the
options as calculated using the simplified method. The estimated volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of
our common stock.</P>

in future receipts of the Company for $2,889,175. Future receipts include cash, check, ACH, credit card, debit card, bank card,
charge card or other form of monetary payment. During 2017, the Company had repaid $1,525,547 and during the year ended December
31, 2018, the Company entered into a total of nine additional Agreements on Future Receipts pursuant to which the Company sold
up to $5,632,400 in future receipts for a purchase price in the amount of $4,100,000. The Agreements on Future Receipts have been

2018, the Company recorded a discount in the amount of $1,651,193 in connection with these nine additional agreements, based upon
the difference between the amount of future receipts sold and the actual proceeds received by the Company. Under the terms of these
agreements, the Company also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,625 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $45.00
per share of common stock and warrants to purchase 8,125 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $50.00 per share of common
stock. The Company recorded an additional discount of $258,370 based on the estimated fair value of these warrants. The Company
computed the fair value of these warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. These discounts are reflected as a reduction
on the outstanding liability and are being amortized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the agreement. During the years
ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, non-cash interest expense of $2,489,403 and $599,337, respectively, was recorded from the amortization
of debt discounts.</P>

based on a borrowing base, which consisted of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable, up to a maximum revolving amount of
$1,400,000 (the &ldquo;Maximum Revolving Amount&rdquo;). Interest accrued at the prime rate plus three and three-quarters percent
(3.75%) on the unpaid principal. Effective June 15, 2017, the prime rate was increased from 4.00% to 4.25% resulting in a base
rate of 8.00%. In December 2017, the Company paid off the Revolving Credit Facility in cash.&nbsp;</P>

issued a 12% promissory note and a warrant to purchase 22,500 shares of common stock to an accredited investor<FONT STYLE="background-color: white">.
</FONT>The promissory note was issued with a 10% OID. The promissory note is in the principal amount of $1,000,000, was sold for
$900,000, accrued simple interest at 12% and was due on June 22, 2018. The Company is in negotiations with the investor to amend
the payment terms on this 12% promissory note, however, since payment was not made on the specified maturity date this unsecured
12% promissory note is currently in default. Interest only payments are due, in arrears, on a monthly basis commencing on April
23, 2018. The exercise price of the warrant is $23.00 per share. The Company recorded debt discount in the amount of $271,565 based
on the estimated fair value of these warrants. The Company computed the fair value of these warrants using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The debt discount was amortized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the debt. During the year ended December
31, 2018, non-cash interest expense of $271,565 was recorded from the amortization of debt discount and interest expense of $100,000
was recorded from the amortization of the OID on this 12% promissory note. The 12% promissory note is unsecured by any of the Company&rsquo;s
assets but is guaranteed by our Chief Executive Officer.</TD></TR></TABLE>

expense of $2,169,613 was recorded from the amortization of debt discounts. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing method. The risk-free rate of 2.94% was derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve, matching the
term of the warrant, in effect at the measurement date. The volatility factor of 127.9% was determined based on the Company&rsquo;s
historical stock prices.</P>

the investors received five and a half year warrants to purchase 8,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $18.00 per
share (collectively the &ldquo;7% Convertible Note Warrants&rdquo;). The 7% Convertible Note Warrants are exercisable commencing
six months after the issuance date. The exercise price of the 7% Convertible Note Warrants is subject to adjustment for customary
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and other standard anti-dilution events. The 7% Convertible Note Warrants may be exercised
for cash or on a cashless basis. The Company computed the fair value of the 7% Convertible Note Warrants using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model and, as a result of this calculation, recorded debt discount in the amount of $61,304 based on the estimated
fair value of the 7% Convertible Note Warrants.</P>

Notes is accounted for under ASC No. <I>470,&nbsp;De</I>bt. At issuance, the estimated fair value of the BCF totaled $31,304. The
fair value of the BCF was allocated from the net proceeds of the 7% Convertible Note and was amortized to interest expense over
the term of the 7% Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. The valuation of the BCF was calculated based on the
effective conversion price compared with the market price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the date of issuance of the Convertible
Note. In aggregate, the Company recorded debt discount in the amount of $93,607 based on the relative fair values of the 7% Convertible
Note Warrants of $61,304 and BCF of $31,304. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the entire non-cash interest expense
of $92,607 was recorded from the amortization of debt discounts.</P>

to purchase 83,334 shares of common stock from $18.00 per share to $11.00 per share and made a payment of $144,000. As a result
of this transaction, the Company recorded additional interest expense of $17,226 and recorded an additional $2,641 in non-cash
interest expense based upon the change in the fair value of the warrants due to the adjustment to the exercise price.&nbsp;</P>

entered into an exchange agreement related to the second 7% Convertible Note. Under the terms of the exchange agreement, the Company
exchanged the 7% Convertible Note for three new promissory notes in the principal amounts of $110,000 due August 1, 2017; $35,000
due August 1, 2017; and $34,000 due August 8, 2017 (individually an Exchange Note and collectively the Exchange Notes) and issued
a new warrant to purchase 4,167 shares of common stock at $11.00 per share and cancelled the prior warrant to purchase 4,167 shares
of common stock at $18.00 per share. The Company recorded a $54,583 extinguishment charge as a result of this transaction.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 0.5in; text-align: justify">Concurrent with entering into
the exchange agreement, the investor entered into a subscription agreement under which the Company issued and sold in a registered
direct offering 10,000 shares of common stock at $11.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $110,000. The 10,000 shares
of common stock were purchased through the cancellation of the Exchange Note in the principal amount of $110,000. In addition,
in a concurrent private placement, the investor entered into a separate securities purchase agreement under which the Company issued
and sold 3,180 shares of common stock at $11.00 per share for an aggregate of purchase price of $35,000. The 3,180 shares of common
stock were purchased through the cancellation of the Exchange Note in the principal amount of $35,000.&nbsp;Further, the Company
issued a warrant&nbsp;to purchase 6,000 shares of common stock at $11.00 per share. The final Exchange Note in the principal amount
of $34,000 was repaid. In aggregate, and including the $54,583 extinguishment charge above, the Company recorded an additional
non-cash interest expense of $110,421 as a result of the extinguishment of the $125,000 7% Convertible Note based on the difference
of the carrying amount of the 7% Convertible Note and the fair value of the consideration transferred, which was determined from
the closing price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the date of extinguishment and based upon (i) the change in the fair value
of the warrants due to the exchange of the warrant with an exercise price of $18.00 per share with a new warrant with an exercise
price of $11.00 per share, (ii) the fair value of the warrant to purchase 6,000 shares of common stock and (iii) the value of the
shares of cash and common stock in excess of the amount owed pursuant to the 7% Convertible Note.</P>

price of the Company&rsquo;s common stock on the date of issuance, it was determined that these discounts represent beneficial
conversion features. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company valued the BCF at $108,049 and 265,054, respectively,

December 22, 2017, the United States enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1, &ldquo;An
Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018&rdquo;
(the &ldquo;Tax Act&rdquo;).&nbsp;</FONT>Introduced initially as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Act to Provide for Reconciliation
Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) was enacted
on December 22, 2017. The Act applies to corporations generally beginning with taxable years starting after December 31, 2017 and
reduces the corporate tax rate from a graduated set of rates with a maximum 35% tax rate to a flat 21% tax rate. Additionally,
the Act introduces other changes that impact corporations, including a net operating loss (&ldquo;NOL&rdquo;) deduction annual
limitation, an interest expense deduction annual limitation, elimination of the alternative minimum tax, and immediate expensing
of the full cost of qualified property. The Act also introduces an international tax reform that moves the U.S. toward a territorial
system, in which income earned in other countries will generally not be subject to U.S. taxation. However, the accumulated foreign
earnings of certain foreign corporations will be subject to a one-time transition tax, which can be elected to be paid over an
eight-year tax transition period, using specified percentages, or in one lump sum. NOL and foreign tax credit (&ldquo;FTC&rdquo;)
carryforwards can be used to offset the transition tax liability. The Company does not expect that this change will have an impact
on the Company as it has not earned taxable income in the past and it has significant NOL carryforwards. <FONT STYLE="background-color: white">The
application of this rate reduction to the ending deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities impacted our expense for income
taxes in 2017 by $1,138,845 which was fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance.&nbsp; </FONT>We applied
the guidance in SAB 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act in 2017 and throughout 2018. At December 31,
2017, we had not completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act under ASC 740, Income Taxes.
At December 31, 2018, we have now completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act. During
2018 we did not need to adjust to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017. <FONT STYLE="background-color: white">The
2017 and 2018 impacts of the enactment of the Tax Act are reflected in the tables below.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company had Federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $43,051,999 and $7,960,184 at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017
respectively, available to offset future taxable income, expiring at various times starting in 2022 through 2039. The net operating
loss generated in 2018 will carryforward indefinitely. In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the future
utilization of the Company&rsquo;s net operating loss to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as
a result of ownership changes that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. Management believes that such
an ownership change may have occurred during 2017. The Company has estimated the Section 382 annual limitation due to this ownership
change to be approximately $157,433. This has been used to reduce the amount of the net operating losses that have limited carryforward
periods.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In assessing the realization
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
After consideration of all of the information available and due to the last five years significant losses there is substantial
doubt related to the Company&rsquo;s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance
of the deferred tax asset. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the valuation allowance has increased by $4,887,148.</P>

for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC No. 740-10-25. ASC No. 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax
benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC No. 740-10-25,
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be
recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amount recorded, such differences impact
income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. Interest and penalties, if any, related to accrued liabilities
for potential tax assessments are included in income tax expense. ASC No. 740-10-25 also requires management to evaluate tax positions
taken by the Company and recognize a liability if the Company has taken uncertain tax positions that more likely than not would
not be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities. Management of the Company has evaluated tax positions taken
by the Company and has concluded that as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there are no uncertain tax positions taken, or expected
to be taken, that would require recognition of a liability that would require disclosure in the financial statements.</P>

Units or Other Stock-Based Awards. If any such deferral election&nbsp;is permitted, the Committee shall establish rules and procedures
for such deferrals and may provide for interest or other earnings to be paid on such deferrals, which rules and procedures shall
be consistent with applicable requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code. Unless otherwise specified in a Non-Employee Director&rsquo;s
valid election, any deferred amount will be deferred until the earliest to occur of the Non-Employee Director&rsquo;s death, separation
from service, or Change of Control; provided that any such deferral election&nbsp;is made by the Non-Employee Director on or prior
to December&nbsp;31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which any such amounts are earned, or, if such Non-Employee
Director is newly eligible for purposes of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, then within 30 days following the date he or she is first
eligible, and then only with respect to amounts earned after the date of the election.</P>
