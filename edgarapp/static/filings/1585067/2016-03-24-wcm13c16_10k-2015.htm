<p>The Westfield Mission Valley Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 9.6% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date, is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Westfield Mission Valley Mortgage Loan which is an asset of the issuing entity and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity. This loan combination, including the Westfield Mission Valley Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the master servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, is also the primary servicer of the loan combination. The responsibilities of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as primary servicer of the loan combination, are subsumed within its responsibilities as master servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Thus, the servicer compliance statement provided by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, encompasses its roles as both master servicer and primary servicer with respect to the loan combination.</p>

<p>The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 5.7% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity. The other pari passu portion of the loan combination was securitized in the WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C15 transaction, Commission File Number 333-177891-05 (the &#8220;WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction&#8221;). This loan combination, including the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as the master servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction, is also the primary servicer of this loan combination. The responsibilities of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as primary servicer of this loan combination, are subsumed within its responsibilities as master servicer under the pooling and servicing agreement for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction.

<p>U.S. Bank National Association acts as trustee of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the pooling and servicing agreement for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements). However, the trustee is not required to deliver such assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria with respect to any reporting period during which there were no servicing criteria applicable to the trustee, as was the case during the reporting period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. One or more other servicers of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan have delivered one or more assessments of compliance with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB.</p>

<p>National Cooperative Bank, N.A. (as successor to NCB, FSB), the NCB master servicer and co-op special servicer, is also a sponsor. Therefore, the Depositor included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K servicer compliance statements for National Cooperative Bank, N.A. pursuant to Item 1123. Because National Cooperative Bank, N.A. is servicing less than 5% of the pool assets, assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountant&#8217;s attestation reports pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB are not required by Regulation AB. As the attestations made in the servicer compliance statements required by Item 1123 relate to a review of the servicing activities of National Cooperative Bank, N.A. under the applicable servicing agreement, and that review was conducted in conjunction with the servicer&#8217;s preparation of its assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, that assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and the accompanying accountant&#8217;s attestation report are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants&#8217; attestation reports from CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC. These entities were engaged by the master servicer (except with respect to those mortgage loans for which National Cooperative Bank, N.A. is the NCB master servicer) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the primary servicer of the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information, and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These services are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii). Therefore, under the principles-based definition of &#8220;servicer&#8221; set forth in Item 1101(j) that looks to the functions that an entity performs, these vendors are &#8220;servicers&#8221; for the purposes of Item 1122.

</div>

<div id="0A431">
<p>The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator and custodian, and CWCapital Asset Management LLC, as special servicer: </p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (&#8220;U.S. Bank&#8221;), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;) trusts. The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo. The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being: BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association, No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794 trusts) and its companion case BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs&#8217; claims vigorously.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts.&#160; On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice.&#160; That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the &#8220;District Court&#8221;) against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the &#8220;Complaint&#8221;). In December 2014, the plaintiffs&#8217; motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief.&#160; Other cases (collectively, the &#8220;Additional Complaints&#8221;) alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs&#8217; claims vigorously.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>On December 17, 2015, U.S. Bank National Association, the trustee under five (5) pooling and servicing agreements for (i) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C30, (ii) COBALT CMBS Commercial Trust 2007-C2, (iii) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C31, (iv) ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-5 and (v) ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-6 commenced a proceeding with the Second Judicial District Court of Ramsey County, Minnesota (&#8220;Court&#8221;) for a declaratory judgment as to the proper allocation of certain proceeds in the alleged amount of $560 million (&#8220;Disputed Proceeds&#8221;) received by CWCapital Asset Management LLC (&#8220;CWCAM&#8221;) in connection with the sale of the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town property in New York, New York (the &#8220;Property&#8221;) securing loans held by those trusts.&#160; CWCAM was the special servicer of the Property. The petition requests the court to instruct the trustee, the trust beneficiaries, and any other interested parties as to the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that constitute penalty interest and/or the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that constitute gain-on-sale proceeds, with respect to each trust. On February 24, 2016, CWCAM made a limited appearance with the Court to file a motion to dismiss this proceeding based on lack of jurisdiction, mootness, standing, and forum non conveniens.&#160; There can be no assurances as to the outcome of this motion or the proceeding or the possible impact on CWCAM. However, CWCAM believes that it has performed its obligations under the related pooling and servicing agreements in good faith, and that the Disputed Proceeds were properly allocated to CWCAM as penalty interest, and it intends to vigorously contest any claim that such Disputed Proceeds were improperly allocated as penalty interest. &#160;&#160;</p>
