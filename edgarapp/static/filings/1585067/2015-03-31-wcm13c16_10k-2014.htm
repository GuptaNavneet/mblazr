<p style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">EXPLANATORY NOTES</p>

<p>The Westfield Mission Valley Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 9.6% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date, is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Westfield Mission Valley Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity. This loan combination, including the Westfield Mission Valley Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. </p>

<p>The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 5.7% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan, which is not an asset of the issuing entity.&#160; The other pari passu portion of the loan combination was securitized in the WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C15 transaction, Commission File Number 333-177891-05 (the &#8220;<u>WFRBS 2013-15 Transaction</u>&#8221;). This loan combination, including the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (&#8220;<u>Wells Fargo Bank</u>&#8221;) is the master servicer and certificate administrator for the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the primary servicer and certificate administrator of the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan. Thus, Wells Fargo Bank is a &#8220;servicer,&#8221; as defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, with respect to these mortgage loans because it is servicing mortgage loans which constituted 10% or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants&#8217; attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Wells Fargo Bank in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index.</p>

<p>NCB, FSB, the NCB master servicer and NCB co-op special servicer, is also a sponsor.&#160; Therefore, the Depositor included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K servicer compliance statements for NCB, FSB pursuant to Item 1123.&#160; Because NCB, FSB is servicing less than 5% of the pool assets, assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountant&#8217;s attestation reports pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB are not required by Regulation AB.&#160; As the attestations made in the servicer compliance statements required by Item 1123 relate to a review of the servicing activities of NCB, FSB under the applicable servicing agreement, and that review was conducted in conjunction with the servicer&#8217;s preparation of its assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, that assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and the accompanying accountant&#8217;s attestation report are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants attestation reports from CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC. These entities were engaged by the master servicer (except with respect to those Mortgage Loans for which Prudential Asset Resources, Inc. is the primary servicer or for which NCB, FSB is the NCB master servicer) and primary servicer with respect to the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information, and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These services are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii). Therefore, under the principles-based definition of &#8220;servicer&#8221; set forth in Item 1101(j) that looks to the functions an entity performs, these vendors are servicers for the purposes of Item 1122. See Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)).</p>

<p>U.S. Bank National Association acts as trustee of the issuing entity and the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the pooling and servicing agreement of the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction, respectively, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements).&#160; However, the trustee is not required to deliver such assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria with respect to any reporting period during which there were no servicing criteria applicable to the trustee, as was the case during the reporting period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the master servicer covers Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>In June 2014, a civil complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, by a group of institutional investors against U.S. Bank National Association (&#8220;<u>U.S. Bank</u>&#8221;), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities ("<u>RMBS</u>") trusts. The plaintiffs are investment funds formed by nine investment advisors (AEGON, BlackRock, Brookfield, DZ Bank, Kore, PIMCO, Prudential, Sealink and TIAA) that purport to be bringing suit derivatively on behalf of 841 RMBS trusts that issued $771 billion in original principal amount of securities between 2004 and 2008. According to the plaintiffs, cumulative losses for these RMBS trusts equal $92.4 billion as of the date of the complaint. The complaint is one of six similar complaints filed against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo Bank) by certain of these plaintiffs. The complaint against U.S. Bank alleges the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and asserts causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaint also asserts that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by appropriate standards of care following events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount and equitable relief. In November 2014, the plaintiffs sought leave to voluntarily dismiss their original state court complaint and filed a substantially similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The federal civil complaint added a class action allegation and a change in the total number of named trusts to 843 RMBS trusts. In December 2014, the plaintiffs&#8217; motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court complaint was granted. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have previously been filed against U.S. Bank and other trustees by RMBS investors in other transactions.</p>

<p>On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the &#8220;Complaint&#8221;). In December 2014, the plaintiffs&#8217; motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees by RMBS investors in these and other transactions. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs&#8217; claims vigorously.</p>

<p>Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.</p>

<p>The information regarding this Item has been previously provided in a prospectus supplement of the Registrant relating to the issuing entity filed on September 27, 2013 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5).</p>

<p>Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. </p>

<p>The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance are attached hereto under Item 15 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attached as Schedule III to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K is a chart identifying the entities participating in a servicing function for the transaction responsible for each applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d).</p>

<p>The reports on assessments of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance with respect to the Augusta Mall Mortgage Loan, which is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction, are attached hereto under Item 15 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.&#160; Attached as Schedule III to the pooling and servicing agreement for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K is a chart identifying the entities participating in a servicing function for the WFRBS 2013-C15 Transaction responsible for each applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d).</p>

<p>The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by CWCapital Asset Management LLC ("<u>CWAM</u>") attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 33.12&#160; discloses that a material instance of noncompliance occurred, as described below:</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Material Instance of Noncompliance by CWAM</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</p>

<p>CWAM's assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of December 31, 2014 and for the Reporting Period, disclosed a material instance of noncompliance that occurred with respect to the servicing criterion set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(i), as follows:</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>With respect to compliance with servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(i), CWAM&#8217;s policies and</p>

<p>procedures were not properly instituted to monitor loan performance or other triggers and events of defaults in accordance with the transaction agreements.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Management's Discussion on Material Instance of Noncompliance by CWAM</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">1122(d)(1)(i): Policies and procedures are instituted to monitor any performance or other triggers and events of default in accordance of the transaction agreements. Timely reporting results of monitoring loan performance to the trusts, in accordance with the transaction agreements.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">&#160;</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Noncompliance:</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">The instance of material noncompliance, for the Reporting Period included a failure to deliver required asset status reports ("ASRs") to the transaction parties in a timely manner with respect to certain agreements for the securitization transactions described in the table below (which do not include the securitization transaction to which this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates).&#160; The preparation and delivery of ASRs to the transaction parties are a component of CWAM's requirements under section 1122(d)(1)(i) of Regulation AB. The typical delivery timeframe ranges from 30 to 90 days and is dependent upon the related transaction agreements. Certain securitizations require ASRs upon transfer of a loan to CWAM.&#160; During the reporting period, CWAM prepared the required ASRs, but failed to deliver the ASRs within the timeframes specified in the transaction agreements.&#160; The ASRs for a total of 34 loans related to 17 securitizations were not delivered on time.&#160; CWAM remedied the issue in December 2014 by delivering all of the delinquent reports.</p>
