1.       BUSINESS

         We are a  development-stage  renewable  energy  company  which plans to
         manufacture biomass-fuelled combined heat and power (CHP) stations that
         produce  renewable and sustainable  "green" energy  products.  Over the
         past 30 years, ecoTECH Energy Group, Inc.  ("ecoTECH")  executives have
         developed and refined a "proprietary thermal  gasification"  technology
         to create  clean-burning  waste-to-energy  cogeneration Power Stations.
         This  combined   heat  and  power  (CHP)   technology   produces:   (i)
         electricity,  which can be channeled to utilities and end-users via the
         electrical infrastructure grid (the "Grid"); and (ii) heat which can be
         used to fuel a  torrefied  biomass  briquette  manufacturing  facility,
         allowing  for a  "green-fuel"  offering  and  related  revenue  stream.
         ecoTECH will  specialize in the  development and operation of CHP Power
         Stations and intends to build five CHP Power Stations in North American
         in the next five to seven years.  In March 2011,  the Company  acquired
         land which it intends to utilize to build its first production plant if
         construction and equity capital is raised by management.

         During April 2011,  the Company  established  an operating  division in
         Montana to engage in operations across the state to manufacture biomass
         energy and grow / distribute our horticulture  products.  We have hired
         three new members to ecoTECH's  management  team to head-up the Montana
         division.

         Also during April 2011, we entered into a Memorandum  of  Understanding
         ("MOU") with Wayzata Investment Partners,  LLC ("Wayzata") to negotiate
         a purchase  agreement  with Thompson  River Power,  LLC ("TRP") and its

2.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of
         ecoTECH have been prepared in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
         generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the
         Securities and Exchange  Commission,  and should be read in conjunction
         with the audited  consolidated  financial  statements and notes thereto
         contained  in the Form  10-K  filed  with the SEC.  In the  opinion  of
         Management,   all   adjustments,   consisting   of   normal   recurring
         adjustments,  necessary for a fair  presentation of financial  position
         and results of operations for the interim  periods  presented have been
         reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not
         necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
         Notes to our  consolidated  financial  statements  which  substantially
         duplicate the  disclosures  contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
         for the year ended December 31, 2010 have been omitted.

         Use of Estimates

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles  generally accepted in the United States of America requires
         management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported
         amounts of assets and  liabilities  and the  disclosure  of  contingent
         assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the
         reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
         These  estimates are based on  management's  best  knowledge of current
         events and  actions the Company  may  undertake  in the future.  Actual
         results may ultimately  differ from those  estimates.  The  significant
         estimates  made by management  relate to the estimation of the value of
         the  Company's  common  stock.  Changes in  estimates  are  reported in
         earnings in the period in which they become known.

         Property, Plant and Equipment

         Land  acquired by purchase  is  recorded at cost.  The amount  recorded
         includes  the  cost of the  land,  as well as any  related  acquisition
         costs.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

         Flow-Through Shares Financing

         The Company has financed a portion of its development-stage  activities
         through the issue of flow-through  shares,  which transfer the Canadian
         tax deductibility of exploration expenditure to the investor.  Proceeds
         received  from the  issuance of such shares are  allocated  between the
         offering of shares and the sale of tax benefits. The allocation is made
         based on the  difference  between the price of the existing  shares and
         the amount the investor pays for the shares.  A liability is recognized
         for the  difference.  Resource  expenditure  deductions  for income tax
         purposes  related to exploration and development  activities  funded by
         flow-through   share   arrangements   are  renounced  to  investors  in
         accordance  with  the  income  tax  legislation  in  Canada.   On  such
         renunciation,  a deferred tax  liability  is created and the  liability
         recognized at issuance reversed.  The Company recognized the benefit of
         tax losses (based on a combined Canadian federal and provincial rate of
         13.5%) to offset the deferred tax liability  resulting in an income tax
         recovery.  During the three months ended  September 30, 2011,  the flow
         through  shares sold  generated a current income tax benefit of $2,895,
         as  reflected  in  the   accompanying   statements  of  operations  and
         comprehensive loss.


3        GOING CONCERN

         The accompanying  consolidated  financial statements have been prepared
         in conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the
         United  States  of  America,  which  contemplates  continuation  of the
         Company as a going  concern.  The  Company  has  incurred  losses  from
         Inception  to  September  30,  2011 of  $33,042,977  and  used  cash in
         operating activities of $1,852,784.  At September 30, 2011, the Company
         had limited  available  capital.  These matters raise substantial doubt
         about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  In view of
         these matters, realization of certain of the assets in the accompanying
         balance  sheets are dependent  upon the  Company's  ability to meet its
         financing  requirements  and  raise  additional  capital,  and upon the
         success of its  future  operations.  The  Company  requires  additional
         capital  of  approximately  $600,000  to  $1,200,000  to  continue  its
         development   activities  and  provide   working  capital  for  general
         corporate  purposes for the next 12 months.  In  addition,  the Company
         needs  to  obtain  financing  of  approximately  $160,000,000  for  the
         construction of the proposed 60 Megawatt  plant.  There is no assurance
         that  our  capital  raising  plans  will  be  successful  in  obtaining
         sufficient  funds to assure the eventual  profitability of the Company.
         We believe that actions planned and presently being taken to revise the
         Company's operating and financial  requirements provide the opportunity
         for the  Company  to  continue  as a going  concern.  The  consolidated
         financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might result
         from these uncertainties.

         Acquisition of Land

         On March 16, 2011 our wholly  owned  subsidiary,  ecoTECH  Energy Group
         (Canada) Inc., completed its acquisition of a parcel of land located in
         McBride,  British  Columbia.  We  purchased  the  property  from Tralee
         Investments Ltd for an aggregate  purchase price of $257,075,  of which
         $51,415  was paid in cash and the  remaining  is  subject to a mortgage
         from the seller, which is included in notes payable on the accompanying
         balance sheet. There is no material relationship (other than in respect
         of the transaction)  between us, our subsidiary purchaser and seller or
         any  of our  affiliates,  or any  of  our  directors,  officers  or any
         associate of any of our officers and directors.

         The  mortgage is for 200,000  Canadian  dollars,  which  translates  to
         $200,351 as of September 30, 2011. The mortgage accrues simple interest
         at 8% annually, calculated monthly, but not in advance, over a two year
         term  expiring  March 15, 2013 and is secured by the land.  Payments of
         $1,587 are due monthly,  with a balloon  payment at  expiration.  As of
         September 30, 2011,  interest expense of approximately $8, 866 has been
         recorded in relationship to this note.

         Company recognized  aggregate  stock-based  compensation expense in the
         amount $697,500 for the above services which is included in general and
         administrative expenses.

         On May 31,  2011,  the  Company  satisfied a $29,841  accounts  payable
         balance  by issuing  64,785  shares of common  stock of ecoTECH  Energy
         Group,  Inc.  to  a  utility  company,   based  on  a  stock  price  of
         approximately  $0.45  per  share.  These  shares  contain  an 18  month
         restriction from the date of issuance.

         During August and September 2011, the Company raised $21,230 though the
         sale of 42,000 shares of common stock via subscription  agreements sold
         under the guidelines of the CRCE program to two  investors,  based on a
         stock  price of  approximately  $0.51 per  share,  for which  $1,003 in
         commissions were paid relative to the sale of this stock. In accordance
         with the sale of CRCE "flow through shares",  the Company recognized an
         income tax credit of $2,835 at September 30, 2011, on the  accompanying
         statement of operations and comprehensive loss contained herein.

         During the three-month  period from July to September 2011, the Company
         raised  $12,157  through  the sale of 32,353  shares  common  stock via
         subscription  agreements sold to four investors,  based on stock prices
         between $0.20 and $0.43 per share.

         Stock based  compensation  expense for the three and nine-months  ended
         September  30,  2011 and  2010 and for the  period  from  Inception  to
         September  30,  2011  was  $112,500,  $0,  $697,500,  $14,929,920,  and
         $25,519,452, respectively.

         Foreign Currency Translation

         The  exchange  rates  used to  translate  amounts in  Canadian  Dollars
         ("CAD$")  into U.S.  Dollars  ("US") for the purposes of preparing  the
         consolidated  financial statements were as follows: As of September 30,
         2011 and December 31, 2010,  the Company used the  period-end  rates of
         exchange for assets and  liabilities of CAD$1 to US$0.9682 and CAD$1 to
         US$1.0015, respectively.

         For the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company used
         the period's average rate of exchange to convert  revenues,  costs, and
         expenses of CAD$1 to US$1.0230 and CAD$1 to US$0.9622, respectively.

         Related-Party Payables

         Related party payables  represent balances in accounts payable that are
         owed to directors and  shareholders.  These  payables are primarily for
         unreimbursed  travel and  entertainment  expenses incurred on behalf of
         the  Company.  The  respective  parties  have  agreed  to  defer  these
         payables,  interest-free,  until a time at which the Company has raised
         sufficient capital.

         Accrued Wages

         Due to capital  restraints,  management  has deferred  certain of their
         monthly  salaries  until  capital is available.  Although  there are no
         employment  agreements,  the Chief Executive  Officer earns $18,000 per
         month;  The Chief  Operating  Officer  earns  $10,000  per  month;  the
         Executive  Vice  President of Business  Development  earns  $10,000 per
         month;  the Executive Vice  President of Engineering  earns $10,000 per
         month,  and the Vice  President  of  Administration  earns  $10,000 per
         month.

         Shareholder Loans

         From time to time,  the four  founding  directors  loaned  money to the
         Company for general  operating  capital.  These loans are repaid to the
         respective  directors  when  additional  capital is raised.  Due to the
         short-term  nature of these loans, the  officers/directors  agreed that
         they  would  not  be  interest  bearing,   and  are  due  upon  demand.
         Shareholder  loans are included in notes payable to related  parties on
         the accompanying  balance sheet.  Net proceeds from  shareholder  loans
         during the nine-months ended September 30, 2011 were $42,652.

         Issuances of Stock

         During  October  2011,  we sold 15,625 common shares of common stock to
         one  investor  for a cash  payment of $5,000.  On October  26, 2011 the
         Board of Directors passed a resolution to issue 2,900,000 common shares
         of  common  stock as stock  based  compensation  at a value of $.45 per

Item 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS

The following information and discussion should be read in conjunction with such
consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto.   Additionally,   this
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operation contains certain  statements that are not strictly  historical and are
"forward-looking"  statements  within  the  meaning  of the  Private  Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty.
Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements  due to other  risks and  uncertainties  that exist in the  Company's
operations,  development efforts and business  environment,  the other risks and
uncertainties  described  in the section  entitled  "Cautionary  Note  Regarding
Forward-Looking  Statements"  at the front of this Report on Form 10-Q,  and our
"Risk Factors" section herein. All  forward-looking  statements  included herein
are based on information available to the Company as of the date hereof, and the
Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement.

CORPORATE HISTORY

We were incorporated  under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 16, 2005
under the name "Sea 2 Sky Corporation". We were initially established to provide
travel  related  services to tourists in Canada and other  countries.  Due to an
economic downturn, we abandoned the travel service business in the first half of
fiscal 2009. Accordingly, results from operations related to the travel business
have  been  reclassified  from  current   operations  to  that  of  discontinued
operations  for proper  financial  presentation.  Effective  March 1,  2009,  we
transitioned  our  business  focus  to that  of a  world-wide  renewable  energy
provider, and became a development-stage company that intended to obtain sources
of biomass  supply  streams and convert  them into green or  alternative  energy
products.

On November 12, 2010, pursuant to the terms of a business combination agreement,
we acquired  100 percent of the issued and  outstanding  common stock of ecoTECH
(Canada),  Inc. for approximately 110 million shares of our common stock,  which
were distributed to the shareholders of the acquired  company.  ecoTECH (Canada)
was amalgamated with 7697112 Canada Corp., a federally incorporated company that
was our wholly owned subsidiary,  and as a result of this amalgamation,  ecoTECH
(Canada)  became  our  wholly  owned   subsidiary.   ecoTECH   (Canada)  has  no
subsidiaries  and is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada or the
United States.

This common stock  transaction,  which represented a majority of the then issued
and outstanding shares of Sea 2 Sky Corporation, constituted a change in control
of the Company. As such, on December 20, 2010, Sea 2 Sky Corporation changed its
name to ecoTECH Energy Group Inc. and its trading symbol to "ECTH". Furthermore,
upon close of the  acquisition,  the  Company  changed  its fiscal  year-end  to
December 31.

OUR BUSINESS

Our  business  will  encompass   development   activities   culminating  in  the
construction and long-term  operation of biomass energy  production  plants.  As
such,  we are  currently in the stage of finding  suitable  locations,  securing
proper financing for building plants,  and deploying  project  opportunities for
converting woody biomass  feedstock into torrefied  bio-energy  products such as
electricity via gasification  process,  activated  carbon,  and "green coal" via
pelletization  process.  As we build these  plants,  we intend to  increase  our
number of employees appropriately.

The Company  intends to  strategically  position  multiple CHP Power Stations in
order to:

     o    Reduce the  reliance on fossil fuels by  providing a  sustainable  and
          environmentally   friendly   source  of  energy   and  fuel   products
          manufactured from local biomass feed-stocks;
     o    Meet specific local needs for decentralized  power, while reducing the
          cost of biomass transportation;
     o    Assist  communities  to meet  federal and state  renewable  energy and
          reduced emissions mandates; and,
     o    Provide  local  jobs  and  community   development   for  the  project
          communities.

Long-term  markets  and goals  have been  identified  for each of our  projects,
designed to fulfill corporate, investor and shareholder requirements.  These can
be summarized as follows:

                                       14
<PAGE>

Renewable Energy Production and Sales:

CHP Power  Stations are modular  units built in chains to meet  specified  power
needs of the community or  communities.  Combined heat and power are produced in
variable  ratios,  depending on the  application.  Local fiber  availability and
transmission  bandwidth are two limiting factors when determining total capacity
to construct.  Hence,  a Power  Station is  expandable  and flexible to changing
environments. Each Power Station project brings baseline income for two to three
decades.  Power supply purchase agreements run from five to thirty years, and we
generally  expect a return on investment  circa 25%, being  unaffected by market
trends.

Green Fuel Production:

Torrefied  Briquettes,   "Green-fuel",   production  allows  an  alternative  to
coal-fired  energy  manufacturers  in order to meet renewable energy mandates by
established deadlines. When wood is roasted ("torrefied"), it becomes brittle at
a certain  temperature  and takes on the attributes of coal, with the exceptions
that it provides greater heat energy by weight,  is sustainably  renewable,  and
meets the  mandated  criteria.  We intend to use surplus  heat  generated by the
Power Stations to provide this torrefaction  process to woody biomass,  which is
then formed into briquettes to be sold at respectable  margins on long-term fuel
supply  contracts with coal-fired  power stations.  This allies our efforts with
the existing coal power giants,  where helping them gives access to transmission
facilities  that would not be afforded a competitor.  Our  projections  indicate
this business segment offers a return on investment (ROI) of approximately 20%.

Ancillary Operations:

Food Production  Projects are  interrelated  self-contained  businesses that can
evolve around the Power Stations, utilizing the surfeit of energy by-products to
support local hydroponic greenhouses and aquaculture fish facilities.

PLAN OF OPERATIONS

The  Company  requires  an  additional  capital  of  approximately  $600,000  to
$1,200,000 to continue its  development  activities and provide  working capital
for general corporate purposes for the next 12 months. In addition,  the Company
needs to obtain financing of approximately  $160,000,000 for the construction of
the proposed 60 Megawatt  plant.  There is no assurance that our capital raising
plans will be  successful in obtaining  sufficient  funds to assure the eventual
profitability of the Company.

Currently, our development stage operations have been funded through the sale of
our common stock.  We plan to raise  additional  funds through Federal and State
grants, loan guarantees,  and project debt financings or through future sales of
our common  stock,  until such time as our revenues are  sufficient  to meet our
cost  structure,  and  ultimately  achieve  profitable  operations.  There is no
assurance that we will be successful in raising  additional capital or achieving
profitable operations.  Our consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

McBride, British Columbia, Canada
---------------------------------

On March 16, 2011, we finalized the purchase of land for the planned first plant
location  in  McBride,  British  Columbia.  The land will be used for one of the
Company's biomass energy production plants along with hydroponic greenhouses and
fish  propagation  facilities,  scheduled for start of construction  late spring
2012

During the following  months,  the Company plans to fund the construction of its
first CHP Power Station projects in McBride,  British Columbia,  Canada, through
debt  financing  (acquired,  subject to successful  due  diligence)  and private
placement  equity  funding,  obtaining  the  estimated  $160  million in capital
required for completion of this two-phase project.  Through  proprietary thermal
gasification technology,  this plant is expected to create a total of 60 MW/hour
of  electricity  which can be channeled via the Grid to utilities and end-users;
and heat  which can be used to fuel  ancillary  operations  such as large  scale

                                       15
<PAGE>

(four-hectare) hydroponic greenhouses, and food fish propagation facilities. The
Company  has  already  secured  long-term   large-tonnage  biomass  fuel  source
agreements to fuel the plants.

Montana
-------

During April 2011,  after  receiving  endorsement  by the  Governor's  office of
Economic  Development,  the Company established an operating division in Montana
to engage in operations across the state to manufacture  biomass energy and grow
/ distribute our horticulture products.

Also during April 2011,  we entered into a Memorandum of  Understanding  ("MOU")
with  Wayzata  Investment  Partners,  LLC  ("Wayzata")  to  negotiate a purchase
agreement with Thompson River Power, LLC ("TRP") and its manager,  Wayzata,  for
the acquisition of 100% of the equity  interests in TRP. The Company has entered
into a Due Diligence  Phase related to this MOU, and hopes to solidify it into a
binding agreement once completed.

During  fiscal 2010,  we signed a letter of intent  agreement  with the Northern
Cheyenne Tribe of Montana to negotiate and enter into definitive  agreements for
the location and operating of a 36MW biomass fuelled  power-plant on certain fee
lands adjacent to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The agreement would provide
for political and economic support, reservation biomass, labor contracting, land
and water rights and many other mutual benefits.

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS

RESULTS OF OPERATION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 COMPARED TO
THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2010

Revenues
We had no revenue for the three months ended  September  30, 2011 and 2010.  The
lack of revenue in both periods is a direct  reflection of the change of control
and  introducing  a new focus and  business  plan.  We do not intend to generate
revenue in the near future until our business plan goals have been met.

General and Administrative Expense
Our general and  administrative  expenses  increased  to $416,944  for the three
months ended  September  30, 2011,  from $302,831 for the  comparable  period in
2010.  The  increase  during  the three  months  ended  September  30,  2011 was
primarily attributable to the increase in stock based compensation of $112,500.

Interest Expense
Our  interest  expense  increased  to $13,515 for the three month  period  ended
September 30, 2011,  from $4,774 for the  comparable  period  during 2010.  This
increase is attributable to increased borrowings during the period.

Loss from Operations
Our net loss from  operations  increased  to $416,944 for the three months ended
September  30,  2011,  from  $302,831  for the  comparable  period in 2010.  The
increase  was  primarily  attributable  to the  increase  in stock  compensation
expense of $112,500.

RESULTS OF OPERATION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER  30, 2011 COMPARED TO
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2010

Revenues
We had no revenue for the nine months  ended  September  30, 2011 and 2010.  The
lack of revenue in both periods is a direct  reflection of the change of control
and  introducing  a new focus and  business  plan.  We do not intend to generate
revenue in the near future until our business plan goals have been met.

                                       16

<PAGE>


General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and  administrative  expenses  decreased to $1,744,304  for the nine
months ended September 30, 2011, from  $15,675,710 for the comparable  period in
2010. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was primarily
attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation of $14,232,420, offset by
an  increase  of  $37,723  in  engineering  and  consulting  costs  incurred  in
connection with preparing the business plan for BC Hydro Phase II on the McBride
British  Columbia  project,  an increase of $269,491 in wages for an increase of
four employees  relative to pursuing the new business focus,  and an increase of
$56,943 in legal and audit costs inherent to public companies.

Interest Expense
Our  interest  expense  increased  to $36,245  for the nine month  period  ended
September 30, 2011,  from $23,788 for the  comparable  period during 2010.  This
increase is attributable to increased borrowings during the period.

Loss from Operations
Our net loss from  operations  decreased to $1,761,741 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2011,  from  $15,675,710  for the  comparable  period in 2010. The
decrease  during  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2011  was  primarily
attributable to the reduction of share based compensation of $14,232,420 between
the two periods.  Absent of stock  compensation,  current  period's  general and
administrative expenses actually increased by $301,014, as described above.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We had total  assets of  $430,888  as of  September  30,  2011,  consisting  of,
$394,652 in net fixed assets,  $21,547 in deposits,  $6,602 in prepaid expenses,
and $2,953 in other receivables. We had a working capital deficit of $3,068,073.

We had total  liabilities of $3,276,402 as of September 30, 2011,  consisting of
$3,082,762 in current liabilities,  which included $654,249 of accounts payable;
accrued wages of $1,863,438;  $311,600 in accrued  consulting  fees;  $19,209 in
accrued  interest;  and short term debt of $234,266 to related  parties.  We had
long term liabilities consisting of a land mortgage for $193,640.

We had a total stockholders' deficit of $2,845,516 as of September 30, 2011, and
an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2011 of $33,278,405.

We had  $134,885 in net cash used in  operating  activities  for the nine months
ended  September  30, 2011,  which  included  $1,780,353 in net loss and $17,628
income  tax  benefit  on  flow-through  shares  which was  offset by  $50,553 in
depreciation;   $697,500  in  stock-based  compensation;  $210,447  in  accounts
payable;  $665,548  in accrued  liabilities;  $38,555 in  deposits,  and $493 in
prepaid expenses. This represents a decrease in cash used of $325,791 over prior
year's  comparable  period,  which is primarily  attributable to the increase in
accounts  payable  balances  and  accrued  salaries  due to limited  funds being
available in the current period.

We had $51,415 in net cash used by  investment  activities,  to  purchase  land,
during the nine months ended  September  30, 2011.  This  represents an increase
cash used in investment  activities over prior year's  comparable  period due to
the purchase of land in the current period.

We had $177,932 of net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months
ended  September 30, 2011,  which included  $20,074 in proceeds from the sale of
common stock and $115,206 in proceeds from the sale of flow-through  shares; and
$42,652 in net proceeds from notes payable by related parties.

On March 16, 2011, we acquired land of which $204,760 was financed through a two
year note at 8%.

Since we have no liquidity and have suffered losses, we depend to a great degree
on the ability to attract  external  financing  in order to conduct our business
activities  and in order  that we have  sufficient  cash on hand to  expand  our
operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern.  If we are unable to raise additional  capital from

                                       17
<PAGE>

conventional  sources,   including  increases  in  related  party  loans  and/or
additional  sales of additional  stock, we may be forced to curtail or cease our
operations.  Even if we are able to  continue  our  operations,  the  failure to
obtain  financing  could have a substantial  adverse  effect on our business and
financial  results.  We have no  commitments to provide us with financing in the
future, other than described above. Our independent registered public accounting
firm  included an  explanatory  paragraph  raising  substantial  doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In the future, we may be required to seek additional  capital by selling debt or
equity securities,  selling assets, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows
in balance when it  approaches a condition  of cash  insufficiency.  The sale of
additional  equity  securities,  if accomplished,  may result in dilution to our
shareholders. We cannot assure you, however, that financing will be available in
amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The  preparation  of the  Company's  financial  statements  in  conformity  with
generally  accepted   accounting   principles  in  the  United  States  requires
management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of
assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  as  well  as the  disclosure  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  The
following  is a summary  of the  significant  accounting  policies  and  related
estimates that affect the Company's financial disclosures.

         Foreign Currency Translations

         The  functional  currency  is the  Canadian  dollar  and the  reporting
         currency is the U.S.  dollar.  At each balance  sheet date,  assets and
         liabilities  that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars
         are adjusted to reflect the current  exchange  rate which may give rise
         to  a  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment  accounted  for  as a
         separate  component  of  shareholders'  equity  and  included  in other
         comprehensive loss.

         Revenues and expenses are  translated at the average daily rate for the
         year covering the financial  statement year to approximate  the rate of
         exchange  on the  transaction  date.  Exchange  gains  and  losses  are
         included in the determination of net income (loss) for the period.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.


ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are a smaller  reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act
and are not required to provide the information required under this item.


ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)  Evaluation  of  disclosure  controls and  procedures.  Our Chief  Executive
Officer and Chief Financial  Officer,  after evaluating the effectiveness of our
"disclosure  controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 Rules  13a-15(e) and  15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period  covered by
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Evaluation  Date"), have concluded that
as of the  Evaluation  Date, our  disclosure  controls and  procedures  were not
effective to provide  reasonable  assurance that  information we are required to
disclose in reports  that we file or submit  under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed,  summarized  and reported  within the time  periods  specified in the

                                       18
<PAGE>

Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and  communicated  to our management,  including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  as appropriate,  to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  In March 2011 our Independent  Registered Public
Accounting  firm  identified  a lack of a  formal  review  process  for  account
reconciliations and complex accounting and reporting matters which increases the
risk that errors or omissions exist and go undetected by management. The Company
will continue to take steps to identify matters of accounting and disclosure.

(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.  There were no changes
in our internal  control over financial  reporting during our most recent fiscal
quarter  that  materially  affected,  or were  reasonably  likely to  materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS

Our internal control over financial  reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation
of consolidated  financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance with
the U.S. GAAP.  Our internal  control over  financial  reporting  includes those
policies and procedures that:

     o    pertain to the  maintenance  of records that,  in  reasonable  detail,
          accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
          assets;
     o    provide  reasonable   assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as
          necessary to permit preparation of consolidated  financial  statements
          in  accordance   with  the  U.S.  GAAP,  and  that  our  receipts  and
          expenditures are being made only in accordance with  authorizations of
          our management and directors; and
     o    provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
          of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or disposition of our assets that
          could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Management does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all
errors  and all  fraud.  A control  system,  no  matter  how well  designed  and
operated,  can  provide  only  reasonable,  not  absolute,  assurance  that  the
objectives  of the  control  system  are met.  Further,  the design of a control
system  must  reflect  the fact that  there are  resource  constraints,  and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the
inherent  limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls
can provide  absolute  assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any,  have been  detected.  Also,  any  evaluation  of the  effectiveness  of
controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal  controls
may become  inadequate  because of changes in business  conditions,  or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exemption From Registration Claimed

All of the above sales by the Company of its  unregistered  securities were made
by the Company in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the  Securities  Act of 1933, as
amended (the "1933 Act"). All of the individuals  and/or entities that purchased
the  unregistered  securities  were  known to the  Company  and its  management,
through pre-existing business relationships. All purchasers were provided access

in  connection  with  their  purchases.   All  purchasers  of  the  unregistered
securities  acquired such  securities  for investment and not with a view toward
distribution,  acknowledging  such intent to the Company.  All  certificates  or
agreements  representing such securities that were issued contained  restrictive
legends,   prohibiting  further  transfer  of  the  certificates  or  agreements
