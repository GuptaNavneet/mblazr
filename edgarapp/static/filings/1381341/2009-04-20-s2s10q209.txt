                      -------------------------------------

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

      While the  information  presented in the  accompanying  interim  financial
      statements is  unaudited,  it includes all  adjustments  which are, in the
      opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position,
      results of operations  and cash flows for the interim  periods  presented.
      Except as disclosed below,  these interim financial  statements follow the
      same accounting policies and methods of their application as the Company's
      audited August 31, 2008 annual financial statements.  It is suggested that
      these  interim  financial  statements  be read  in  conjunction  with  the
      Company's August 31, 2008 audited financial statements.

      The information as of August 31, 2008 is taken from the audited  financial
      statements of that date.


2.    NATURE AND CONTINUENCE OF OPERATIONS

     a)  Organization

         The Company was  incorporated in the State of Nevada,  United States of
         America, on November 16, 2005. The Company's year end is August 31st.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         This summary of significant  accounting policies is presented to assist
         in  understanding  the Company's  financial  statements.  The financial
         statements and notes are  representations  of the Company's  management
         who  is  responsible  for  their  integrity  and   objectivity.   These
         accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles
         in the United States of America and have been  consistently  applied in
         the preparation of the financial  statements.  The financial statements
         are stated in United States of America dollars.

         a)   Organizational and Start-up Costs


              Costs of start-up activities,  including organizational costs, are
              expensed as incurred in accordance with SOP 98-5.

         b)   Income Taxes

              The  Company has adopted the  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
              Standards No. 109 - "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). SFAS
              109  requires  the  use of  the  asset  and  liability  method  of
              accounting of income taxes.  Under the asset and liability  method
              of SFAS 109,  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized
              for  the  future  tax   consequences   attributable  to  temporary
              differences  between the financial  statements carrying amounts of
              existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax bases.
              Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
              rates  expected  to apply to taxable  income in the years in which
              those  temporary  differences  are  expected  to be  recovered  or
              settled.

         c)   Basic and Diluted Loss per Share

              In accordance with SFAS No. 128 - "Earnings Per Share",  the basic
              loss per common share is computed by dividing  net loss  available
              to common  stockholders  by the weighted  average number of common
              shares  outstanding.  Diluted  loss per common  share is  computed
              similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator
              is increased  to include the number of  additional  common  shares
              that would have been  outstanding  if the potential  common shares

                      NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                      -------------------------------------

              had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
              At February 28, 2009,  the Company had no stock  equivalents  that
              were   anti-dilutive  and  excluded  in  the  earnings  per  share
              computation.

         d)   Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments

              The  carrying  value  of  the  Company's  financial   instruments,
              consisting of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued
              liabilities  approximate  their fair  value due to the  short-term
              maturity  of  such  instruments.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  it is
              management's   opinion   that  the   Company  is  not  exposed  to
              significant interest,  currency or credit risks arising from these
              financial statements.

         e)   Revenue Recognition

              The Company's policy is that revenues are recognized in accordance
              with  SEC  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  (SAB)  No.  104,  "Revenue
              Recognition."   Under  SAB  104,   product  revenues  (or  service
              revenues)  are   recognized   when   persuasive   evidence  of  an
              arrangement  exists,  delivery  has  occurred (or service has been
              performed),   the  sales  price  is  fixed  and  determinable  and
              collectability is reasonably assured.

         f)   Foreign Currency Translations

              The Company's uses the  Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar as its
              functional currency.  The Company's reporting currency is the U.S.
              dollar.  All  transactions initiated  in  other currencies are re-
              measured into the functional currency as follows:

              Monetary  assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect
              at the balance sheet date,
              ii)  Non-monetary assets and liabilities, and equity at historical
              rates, and
              iii) Revenue and  expense  items at  the average  rate of exchange
              prevailing during the period.

              Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in determining net
              income for the period.

              Translation  of balances  from the  functional  currency  into the
              reporting currency is conducted as follows:

              Assets and  liabilities  at the rate of  exchange in effect at the
              balance sheet date,
              ii)  Equity at historical rates, and
              iii) Revenue  and expense  items at the  average  rate of exchange
              prevailing during the period.

              Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  translation of balances
              from  functional  to  reporting  currency  are  accumulated  as  a
              separate  component  of  shareholders'  equity as a  component  of
              comprehensive income or loss.

         g)   Comprehensive Income (Loss)

              The  Company has adopted  SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
              Income".  SFAS 130 requires that the  components and total amounts
              of comprehensive  income be displayed in the financial  statements
              beginning in 1998.  Comprehensive  income  includes net income and
              all changes in equity  during a period that arises from  non-owner
              sources,  such as foreign  currency items and unrealized gains and
              losses on certain investments in equity securities.

         h)   Use of Estimates

              The   preparation  of  the  Company's   financial   statements  in
              conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires

                      NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                      -------------------------------------
                                February 28, 2009
                                   (Unaudited)

              management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the
              amounts  reported in these financial  statements and  accompanying
              notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

         i)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

              The Company  considers all highly liquid debt  instruments with an
              original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

         j)   Property and Equipment

              Property and equipment are recorded at cost and  depreciated  over
              their estimated useful lives.  The Company uses the  straight-line
              method of depreciation.

              Expenditures  for  maintenance and repairs which do not materially
              extend the useful lives of property and  equipment  are charged to
              earnings. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed
              of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
              the respective  accounts with the resulting gain or loss reflected
              in earnings.

         k)   Website Development Costs

              Website  development  costs  representing   capitalized  costs  of
              design,  configuration,  coding,  installation  and testing of the
              Company's  website is  capitalized  until initial  implementation.
              Upon  implementation,  the asset is  amortized to expense over its
              estimated  useful  life of three  years  using  the  straight-line
              method.  In February  2009 the  original  website had no remaining
              useful life and was expensed.

              A  new  website  was  developed  in  February  2009.   Accumulated
              amortization  at  February  28,  2009  was  $28.  Ongoing  website
              post-implementation  costs of  operation,  including  training and
              application maintenance, will be charged to expense as incurred.

         l)   Long-Lived Assets

              The Company accounts for its long-lived  assets in accordance with
              Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards 144,  Accounting for
              the  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets (SFAS 144).  The
              Company's primary long-lived assets are property and equipment and
              website  development  costs. SFAS 144 requires a company to assess
              the  recoverability  of its long-lived  assets whenever events and
              circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  value of an asset or asset
              group may not be  recoverable  from  estimated  future  cash flows
              expected  to  result  from  its  use  and  eventual   disposition.
              Additionally,  the standard  requires  expected  future  operating
              losses  from   discontinued   operations   to  be   displayed   in
              discontinued  operations  in the  period in which the  losses  are
              incurred,  rather than as of the  measurement  date. No impairment
              charges have been recorded as of February 28, 2009.

         m)   Advertising

              The  Company  expenses  the  cost of  advertising  when  incurred.
              Advertising   expenses   are  included   with   marketing  in  the
              accompanying statements of operations.

         n)   Concentrations

              Financial  instruments that potentially  subject  the company  to
              concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
              equivalents. At February 28, 2009, the Company had $8,749 US Funds
              in deposit in a business  bank account,  and US equivalent of $755
              in Canadian funds in a business bank account which are not insured
              by agencies of the U.S. Government.

         n)   Recent Accounting Pronouncements

              There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued
              during  2008  and  2007,  none of  which  are  expected  to have a

              material impact on the Company's  consolidated financial position,
              operations or cash flows.

         o)   Other

              The  Company  consists of one  reportable  business  segment.  The
              Company paid no dividends during the periods presented.


4.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION - GOING CONCERN

         The accompanying  financial statements have been prepared in conformity
         with generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States of
         America,  which  contemplates  continuation  of the  Company as a going
         concern.  However,  the Company has an accumulated  deficit as February
         28, 2009 of $96,859.  This matter  raises  substantial  doubt about the
         Company's  ability to  continue  as a going  concern.  In view of these
         matters,  realization  of  certain  of the  assets in the  accompanying
         balance  sheet is  dependent  upon the  Company's  ability  to meet its
         financing  requirements,  raise additional capital,  and the success of
         its  future  operations.  There is no  assurance  that  future  capital
         raising  plans will be  successful  in  obtaining  sufficient  funds to
         assure the eventual  profitability of the Company.  Management believes
         that actions  planned and presently being taken to revise the Company's
         operating and financial  requirements  provide the  opportunity for the
         Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
         include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

5.       COMMON STOCK

         The Company's  authorized  common stock consists of 225,000,000  shares
         with a par value of $0.001 per share.

         On December  30,  2008,  our Board of  Directors  authorized a 30-for-1
         forward  stock split of our $0.001 par value common  stock.  This share
         dividend became effective February 17, 2009. As a result of the forward
         stock split,  127,020,000  additional  shares were issued.  Capital and
         additional  paid-in  capital  have  been  adjusted   accordingly.   All
         references in the  accompanying  financial  statements to the number of
         common shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to
         reflect the forward stock split.

         On February 10, 2009,  our  Articles of  Incorporation  were amended to
         change the aggregate  number of shares which we have authority to issue
         to two  hundred  twenty  five  million  (225,000,000)  shares of common
         stock, par value $0.001 per share.

         On  February  10,  2009,   our  Board  of  Directors   authorized   the
         cancellation of 48,000,000  post  forward-split  common  shares.  These
         restricted shares were owned  by Mr. Dennis  Cox and were cancelled for
         no consideration  at his request.  This became  effective  February 24,
         2009. There are presently 83,400,000 common shares issued and outstand-
         ing.

6.       INCOME TAXES

         The Company is subject to US federal income taxes.  The Company has had
         losses to date, and therefore has paid no income tax.

                                   (Unaudited)

         Deferred  income taxes arise from temporary  timing  differences in the
         recognition  of income and expenses  for  financial  reporting  and tax
         purposes.  The Company's  deferred tax assets  consist  entirely of the
         benefit from net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards. The net operating
         loss carry forwards  expire in 2028. The Company's  deferred tax assets
         are  offset by a  valuation  allowance  due to the  uncertainty  of the
         realization  of the net operating  loss  carry-forwards.  Net operating
         loss  carry-forwards  may be  further  limited  by a change in  company
         ownership and other provisions of the tax laws.

         The Company's deferred tax assets,  valuation allowance,  and change in
         valuation allowance are as follows:

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS

The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with our  unaudited
financial  statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with, and
because we desire to take  advantage  of, the "safe  harbor"  provisions  of the
Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding
certain forward looking statements in the following  discussion and elsewhere in
this report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not
in future filings with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Forward-looking
statements are statements not based on historical  information  and which relate
to future  operations,  strategies,  financial results,  or other  developments.
Forward-looking  statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions
that are inherently subject to significant business,  economic, and competitive,
uncertainties and  contingencies,  many of which are beyond our control and many
of which,  with  respect to future  business  decisions,  are subject to change.
These  uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any  forward-looking
statements  made by, or on our behalf.  We  disclaim  any  obligation  to update
forward-looking statements.

The following discussion of the plan of operation,  financial condition, results
of  operations,  cash flows and  changes in  financial  position  of our Company
should be read in  conjunction  with our most recent  financial  statements  and
notes appearing  elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, in our Form 10-Q filed January 12,
2009 and in our Form 10-K filed on November  25, 2008 and our Current  Report on
Form 8K filed March 31, 2009.

The  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm's report on the Company's
financial   statements  as  of  August  31,  2008,  include  a  "going  concern"
explanatory  paragraph  that  describes  substantial  doubt about the  Company's
ability to  continue  as a going  concern.  Management's  plans in regard to the
factors prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed below and also in Note
4 to the unaudited quarterly financial statements.

Plan of Operations

Sea 2 Sky Corporation  (the "Company") has had limited  operations over the last
three  years.  Our  business  plan  focused  on  providing  a  professional  and
personalized  all-inclusive  travel package to tourists  visiting western Canada
and specifically the Province of Alberta. A personal assistant would be assigned
to each  client to ensure  that  every  aspect  of the trip was  considered  and
addressed and to bridge the language barrier in order to prevent frustration for
travelers.

We had planned to establish a travel  agency  affiliate in a major city in Japan
and eventually develop in five major cities overseas while continuing  marketing
efforts through the Internet.  The intent was to create  strategic  partnerships
with travel and special-event  companies in order to grow the customer base. The
desired results were not achieved.

Change in Management

As a result of limited revenues in a very difficult economic environment, two of
the founding  directors Ms. Rose and Ms. Hamilton resigned.  Messrs.  Dennis Cox
and Stan Dusza were  appointed to the Board of Directors on July 29, 2008.  Both
had increased business experience;  however, their experience was not in tourism
and travel. With continuing limited revenues from travel operations,  management
had to consider other business growth opportunities.

The Company has expanded the number of Board members from three (3) to seven (7)
members to broaden the experience  base. In December 2008,  Messrs.  Henry James
and Doug Robertson,  both having  extensive  experience in the forestry  sector,
were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.

Messrs. James and Robertson have worked in the forestry sector together and have
been  involved  with forestry  issues  between  Canada and the United States and
cross border  shipping of forest  products.  As a Native  American,  Henry James
suggested  the Company begin to  investigate  opportunities  in working  between
indigenous groups in Canada to see if opportunities  existed for forest products
trading in United States, Canada or abroad.

                                       3

<PAGE>

Due to  their  legal,  accounting  and  international  business  experience,  on
February  23,  2009,  Messrs.  David  Siebenga,  Erik Odeen and Ira Steiner were
appointed to the Board of Directors to continue  investigations  of trading wood
supplies between United States,  Canada and abroad. David Siebenga was appointed
the Company's Chief Executive Officer on February 26, 2009 and is an attorney in
and from the  Province  of British  Columbia,  who over the 20 plus years of his
career, has dealt with companies in different international contexts. The  Board
accepted the  resignation  of Irene Getty who had served as the Company's  Chief
Executive Officer since its inception in November 2005.

Erik  Odeen who was  appointed  the  Company's  new Chief  Financial  Officer on
February 26, 2009, is a Certified  Public  Accountant in the State of California
and a Certified Fraud Examiner,  with over 20 years  experience in manufacturing
operations,  financial management, and public accounting. The Board accepted the
resignation  of Dennis  Cox who had  served  as the  Company's  Chief  Financial
Officer since July 2008.

Ira Steiner was  appointed to the Board of Directors to provide the Company with
contacts in the European  marketplace.  An Austrian  native with  long-term wood
sales experience, Mr. Steiner's role within the Company is to source markets and
contacts to sell biomass and alternative fuels in Europe and other countries.

Change of Operational Focus

The  Company is  exploring  an emerging  opportunity  in the  alternative  fuel,
biomass  sector of the  forest  industry.  As a result  of the  native to native
contacts,  the  Canadian  First  Nations  people  have shown  great  interest in
developing  a working  relationship  with the  Company  by  providing  long term
biomass (wood supply) contracts,  provided that those First Nations could obtain
jobs in their local community.

Plan of Operations

In order to fully evaluate the emerging opportunity, we intend to proceed in two
stages.  The  first  stage  is  to  establish  ourselves  in  the  supply  chain
marketplace by meeting and finalizing various  memorandums of understanding with
First Nations peoples who wish to deal with us. Concurrently,  we will meet with
various Pellet Plant  manufacturers  to determine the best fit for the Company's
needs for plants as well as continue to pursue markets for the pellets produced.
Once this preliminary evaluation is done, we anticipate placing a deposit on our
first plant.  Thereafter,  upon  production  and having the ability to go to the
market with its Pellet product,  we anticipate creating further plants as demand
increases.  We intend to raise  $1,000,000 to fund its initial  requirement.  We
cannot make any assurances that we will be able to raise such funds.

In anticipation of achieving our funding requirements,  we, as a manufacturer of
wood  pellets,  are  beginning to negotiate  with  various  consumer  groups and
suppliers of wood pellets to market  within Europe and North America in order to
secure contracts to deliver  pellet-able  biomass for their customers.  Once the
supply  and  market  positions  are  secured,  we will  seek  financing  for the
construction  of pellet mills to be placed on the First Nations (or other) sites
within  western  Canada,  thus producing jobs for the local area and pellets for
sale in the  marketplace.  Based on current  research,  we are aware of and have
leads into  approximately 20 different  locations suitable for pellet production
within British Columbia;  Alberta, Canada; three states within the United States
of America; and New Zealand. Based on current market demand and trends, we see a
market opportunity to produce for sale and sell over 1.3 million tons of pellets
per year.

Once the pellet mill has been  constructed,  we plan to market these  pellets to
both North American and international markets.  There is no assurance,  however,
that we will be able to raise such funds and allow us to carry out its business.

Equity Events

On December 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a 30-for-1 forward stock
split of our $0.001 par value common stock. This share dividend became effective
February  17,  2009.  As a  result  of  the  forward  stock  split,  127,020,000
additional shares were issued.  Capital and additional paid-in capital have been
adjusted accordingly. All references in the accompanying financial statements to
the  number  of common  shares  and per share  amounts  have been  retroactively
restated to reflect the forward stock split.


                                       4
<PAGE>

On February 10, 2009, our Articles of  Incorporation  were amended to change the
aggregate  number  of shares  which we have  authority  to issue to two  hundred
twenty five million  (225,000,000)  shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share.  Also,  on February  10,  2009,  our Board of  Directors  authorized  the
cancellation of 48,000,000 post  forward-split  common shares.  These restricted
shares were owned by Mr. Dennis Cox and were cancelled for no  consideration  at
his  request.  This became  effective  February 24,  2009.  There are  presently
83,400,000 common shares issued and outstanding.


Liquidity

At February  28,  2009,  we had working  capital of $9,034,  compared to working
capital of $28,382 at August 31, 2008.  At February  28, 2009,  our total assets
consisted of cash of $9,504, prepaid expenses of $2,512, net office equipment of
$1,386, net computer  equipment of $1,805,  and net website  development of $972
for a total of $16,179.  This compares with total assets at August 31, 2008 that
consisted of cash of $36,465,  prepaid expenses of $417, net office equipment of
$1,575, net computer equipment of $2,347, and net website  development of $3,372
for a total of $44,176.

At February 28, 2009, our total current  liabilities were accrued liabilities of
$2,982.  This was a decrease from total current  liabilities of $8,500 at August
31, 2008, which consisted of accounts payable of $2,000 and accrued  liabilities
of $6,500.

Cash on hand is  currently  our only  source  of  liquidity.  We do not have any
lending  arrangements in place with banking or financial  institutions and we do
not anticipate that we will be able to secure these funding  arrangements in the
near future.

We recognized  $1,165 in revenues from  operations  during the six months ending
February 28, 2009.  Our short and long term  survival is dependent on sufficient
revenue resulting in a profitable  operation or funding from sales of securities
as necessary.

We believe our  existing  cash  balances  are  insufficient  to carry our normal
operations over the next three (3) months.  Our short and long-term  survival is
dependent on funding from sales of securities  as necessary or from  shareholder
loans,  and thus, to the extent that we require  additional funds to support our
operations or the expansion of our business,  we may attempt to sell  additional
equity  shares or issue debt.  Any sale of  additional  equity  securities  will
result in dilution  to our  stockholders.  Recent  events in  worldwide  capital
markets may make it more difficult for us to raise additional equity or capital.
There can be no  assurance  that  additional  financing,  if  required,  will be
available to us or on acceptable terms.

In  addition,  the  United  States is  experiencing  severe  instability  in the
commercial  and investment  banking  systems which is likely to continue to have
far-reaching   effects  on  the   economic   activity  in  the  country  for  an
indeterminable period. The long-term impact on the United States economy and the
Company's operating  activities and ability to raise capital cannot be predicted
at this time, but may be substantial.

Results of Operations

For The Three Months Ended  February 28, 2009 Compared To The Three Months Ended
February 28, 2008.

We did not recognize any revenues from operations during the three months ending
February  28,  2009,  compared  to  $9,605 in  revenues  from the sale of travel
packages  during the three months ending  February 28, 2008.  Cost of goods sold
for the three months ended  February 28, 2008 were $8,800,  resulting in a gross
profit of $805.  The  decrease of $9,605 in revenues was a result of our efforts
during the six months ended  February 28, 2009 to modify and change our business
plan, as discussed previously.
