ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The management of Sea 2 Sky, with the  participation of our principal  executive
and  financial  officer,  has  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of our  disclosure
controls  and  procedures  in  ensuring  that  the  information  required  to be
disclosed in our filings under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, including
ensuring that such  information is  accumulated  and  communicated  to Sea 2 Sky
management  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely  decisions   regarding   required
disclosure.  Based on such  evaluation,  our  principal  executive and financial
officers  have  concluded  that such  disclosure  controls and  procedures  were
effective  as of August 31,  2009 (the end of the period  covered by this Annual
Report on Form 10-K).

ITEM 9T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible  for  establishing  and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The internal control process
has been  designed,  under our  supervision,  to  provide  reasonable  assurance
regarding the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of the
Company's  financial  statements for external  reporting  purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management  conducted  an  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of  the  Company's
internal control over financial  reporting as of August 31, 2008,  including (i)
the control environment,  (ii) risk assessment,  (iii) control activities,  (iv)
information and  communication,  and (v)  monitoring,  based on the framework in
INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED  FRAMEWORK,  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission  ("COSO").  As of August  31,  2009,
management has  determined  that the Company's  internal  control over financial
reporting was effective as of August 31, 2009. As the Company grows,  steps will
be taken to ensure that additional  financial experts are sequestered to provide
secondary review of all financials and related disclosures filed with the SEC.

Our internal control over financial  reporting  includes policies and procedures
that pertain to the  maintenance of records that  accurately and fairly reflect,
in reasonable  detail,  transactions  and  dispositions  of assets;  and provide
reasonable assurances that: (1) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States; (2) receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with  authorizations  of management and the directors of
the Company;  and (3)  unauthorized  acquisitions,  use, or  disposition  of the
Company's  assets that could have a material  effect on the Company's  financial
statements are prevented or timely detected.

                                      -4-

All  internal  control  systems,  no matter  how well  designed,  have  inherent
limitations.  Therefore,  even those  systems  determined  to be  effective  can
provide  only   reasonable   assurance  with  respect  to  financial   statement
preparations  and  presentations.   Also,   projections  of  any  evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

During our fiscal  quarter  ended  August 31,  2009,  there were no  significant
changes in our internal controls over financial  reporting,  as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and  15d-15(f)  under the Exchange Act, or in other factors that could
significantly  affect these controls  subsequent to the evaluation date. We have
not  identified  any  significant  deficiencies  or material  weaknesses  in our
internal controls, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken.
