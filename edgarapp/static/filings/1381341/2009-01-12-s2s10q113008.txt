                      NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                November 30, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)


1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

      While the  information  presented in the  accompanying  interim  financial
      statements is  unaudited,  it includes all  adjustments  which are, in the
      opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position,
      results of operations  and cash flows for the interim  periods  presented.
      Except as disclosed below,  these interim financial  statements follow the
      same accounting policies and methods of their application as the Company's
      audited August 31, 2008 annual financial statements.  It is suggested that
      these  interim  financial  statements  be read  in  conjunction  with  the
      Company's August 31, 2008 audited financial statements.

      The information as of August 31, 2008 is taken from the audited  financial
      statements of that date.

2.    NATURE AND CONTINUENCE OF OPERATIONS

     a)  Organization

         The Company was  incorporated in the State of Nevada,  United States of
         America, on November 16, 2005. The Company's year end is August 31st.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         This summary of significant  accounting policies is presented to assist
         in  understanding  the Company's  financial  statements.  The financial
         statements and notes are  representations  of the Company's  management
         who  is  responsible  for  their  integrity  and   objectivity.   These
         accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles
         in the United States of America and have been  consistently  applied in
         the preparation of the financial  statements.  The financial statements
         are stated in United States of America dollars.

         a)   Organizational and Start-up Costs

              Costs of start-up activities,  including organizational costs, are
              expensed as incurred in accordance with SOP 98-5.

         b)   Income Taxes

              The  Company has adopted the  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
              Standards No. 109 - "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). SFAS
              109  requires  the  use of  the  asset  and  liability  method  of
              accounting of income taxes.  Under the asset and liability  method
              of SFAS 109,  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are recognized
              for  the  future  tax   consequences   attributable  to  temporary
              differences  between the financial  statements carrying amounts of
              existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax bases.
              Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
              rates  expected  to apply to taxable  income in the years in which
              those  temporary  differences  are  expected  to be  recovered  or
              settled.

         c)   Basic and Diluted Loss per Share

              In accordance with SFAS No. 128 - "Earnings Per Share",  the basic
              loss per common share is computed by dividing  net loss  available
              to common  stockholders  by the weighted  average number of common
              shares  outstanding.  Diluted  loss per common  share is  computed
              similar to basic loss per common share except that the denominator
              is increased  to include the number of  additional  common  shares
              that would have been  outstanding  if the potential  common shares

                      NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                November 30, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

              had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
              At November 30, 2008,  the Company had no stock  equivalents  that
              were   anti-dilutive  and  excluded  in  the  earnings  per  share
              computation.

         d)   Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments

              The  carrying  value  of  the  Company's  financial   instruments,
              consisting of accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate
              their  fair  value  due  to  the   short-term   maturity  of  such
              instruments.  Unless otherwise  noted, it is management's  opinion
              that the Company is not exposed to significant interest,  currency
              or credit risks arising from these financial statements.

         e)   Revenue Recognition

              The Company's policy is that revenues are recognized in accordance
              with  SEC  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  (SAB)  No.  104,  "Revenue
              Recognition."   Under  SAB  104,   product  revenues  (or  service
              revenues)  are   recognized   when   persuasive   evidence  of  an
              arrangement  exists,  delivery  has  occurred (or service has been
              performed),   the  sales  price  is  fixed  and  determinable  and
              collectability is reasonably assured.

         f)   Foreign Currency Translations

              The Company's uses the Canadian  dollar and the U.S. dollar as its
              functional currency.  The Company's reporting currency is the U.S.
              dollar.  All  transactions  initiated in other  currencies are re-
              measured into the functional currency as follows:

              Monetary  assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect
              at  the  balance   sheet  date,   ii)   Non-monetary   assets  and
              liabilities,  and equity at historical  rates, and iii)Revenue and
              expense  items at the average rate of exchange  prevailing  during
              the period.

              Gains and losses on re-measurement are included in determining net
              income for the period

              Translation  of balances  from the  functional  currency  into the
              reporting currency is conducted as follows:

              Assets and  liabilities  at the rate of  exchange in effect at the
              balance  sheet  date,   ii)  Equity  at  historical   rates,   and
              iii)Revenue  and  expense  items at the  average  rate of exchange
              prevailing during the period.

              Translation  adjustments  resulting  from  translation of balances
              from  functional  to  reporting  currency  are  accumulated  as  a
              separate  component  of  shareholders'  equity as a  component  of
              comprehensive income or loss.

         g)   Comprehensive Income (Loss)

              The  Company has adopted  SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
              Income".  SFAS 130 requires that the  components and total amounts
              of comprehensive  income be displayed in the financial  statements
              beginning in 1998.  Comprehensive  income  includes net income and
              all changes in equity  during a period that arises from  non-owner
              sources,  such as foreign  currency items and unrealized gains and
              losses on certain investments in equity securities.

         h)   Use of Estimates

              The   preparation  of  the  Company's   financial   statements  in
              conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires
              management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the

                              SEA 2 SKY CORPORATION

                      NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                November 30, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

              amounts  reported in these financial  statements and  accompanying
              notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

         i)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

              The Company  considers all highly liquid debt  instruments with an
              original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

         j)   Property and Equipment

              Property and equipment are recorded at cost and  depreciated  over
              their estimated useful lives.  The Company uses the  straight-line
              method of depreciation.

              Expenditures  for  maintenance and repairs which do not materially
              extend the useful lives of property and  equipment  are charged to
              earnings. When property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed
              of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
              the respective  accounts with the resulting gain or loss reflected
              in earnings.

         k)   Website Development Costs

              Website  development  costs  representing   capitalized  costs  of
              design,  configuration,  coding,  installation  and testing of the
              Company's  website is  capitalized  until initial  implementation.
              Upon  implementation,  the asset is  amortized to expense over its
              estimated  useful  life of three  years  using  the  straight-line
              method.  Accumulated amortization at November 30, 2008 was $1,686.
              Ongoing website post-implementation costs of operation,  including
              training and application  maintenance,  will be charged to expense
              as incurred.

         l)   Long-Lived Assets

              The Company accounts for its long-lived  assets in accordance with
              Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards 144,  Accounting for
              the  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets (SFAS 144).  The
              Company's primary long-lived assets are property and equipment and
              website  development  costs. SFAS 144 requires a company to assess
              the  recoverability  of its long-lived  assets whenever events and
              circumstances  indicate  the  carrying  value of an asset or asset
              group may not be  recoverable  from  estimated  future  cash flows
              expected  to  result  from  its  use  and  eventual   disposition.
              Additionally,  the standard  requires  expected  future  operating
              losses  from   discontinued   operations   to  be   displayed   in
              discontinued  operations  in the  period in which the  losses  are
              incurred,  rather than as of the  measurement  date. No impairment
              charges have been recorded as of November 30, 2008.

         m)   Advertising

              The  Company  expenses  the  cost of  advertising  when  incurred.
              Advertising   expenses   are  included   with   marketing  in  the
              accompanying statements of operations.

         n)   Concentrations

              Financial  instruments that  potentially  subject  the  company to
              concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
              equivalents.  At November 30,  2008,  the Company  had  $12,543 US
              Funds in deposit in a business  bank account, and US equivalent of
              $11,233 in Canadian funds in a business bank account which are not
              insured by agencies of the U.S. Government

                      NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                November 30, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

         o)   Recent Accounting Pronouncements

              There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued
              during  2008  and  2007,  none of  which  are  expected  to have a
              material impact on the Company's  consolidated financial position,
              operations or cash flows.

         p)   Other

              The  Company  consists of one  reportable  business  segment.  The
              Company paid no dividends during the periods presented.


4.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION - GOING CONCERN

         The accompanying  financial statements have been prepared in conformity
         with generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States of
         America,  which  contemplates  continuation  of the  Company as a going
         concern.  However,  the Company has an accumulated  deficit as November
         30, 2008 of $86,910.  This matter  raises  substantial  doubt about the
         Company's  ability to  continue  as a going  concern.  In view of these
         matters,  realization  of  certain  of the  assets in the  accompanying
         balance  sheet is  dependent  upon the  Company's  ability  to meet its
         financing  requirements,  raise additional capital,  and the success of
         its  future  operations.  There is no  assurance  that  future  capital
         raising  plans will be  successful  in  obtaining  sufficient  funds to
         assure the eventual  profitability of the Company.  Management believes
         that actions  planned and presently being taken to revise the Company's
         operating and financial  requirements  provide the  opportunity for the
         Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not
         include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.


5.       COMMON STOCK

         The Company's  authorized  common stock  consists of 75,000,000  shares
         with a par value of $0.001 per share.


6.       INCOME TAXES

         The Company is subject to US federal income taxes.  The Company has had
         losses to date, and therefore has paid no income tax.

         Deferred  income taxes arise from temporary  timing  differences in the
         recognition  of income and expenses  for  financial  reporting  and tax
         purposes.  The Company's  deferred tax assets  consist  entirely of the
         benefit from net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards. The net operating
         loss carry forwards  expire in 2028. The Company's  deferred tax assets
         are  offset by a  valuation  allowance  due to the  uncertainty  of the
         realization  of the net operating  loss  carry-forwards.  Net operating
         loss  carry-forwards  may be  further  limited  by a change in  company
         ownership and other provisions of the tax laws.

7.       RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

      The Company  uses the  offices of its  Treasurer  for its  minimal  office
      facility needs for no consideration. No provision for these costs has been
      provided since it has been determined that they are immaterial.

Item 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS

The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with our  unaudited
financial  statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with, and
because we desire to take  advantage  of, the "safe  harbor"  provisions  of the
Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding
certain forward looking statements in the following  discussion and elsewhere in
this report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not
in future filings with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Forward-looking
statements are statements not based on historical  information  and which relate
to future  operations,  strategies,  financial results,  or other  developments.
Forward-looking  statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions
that are inherently subject to significant business,  economic, and competitive,
uncertainties and  contingencies,  many of which are beyond our control and many
of which,  with  respect to future  business  decisions,  are subject to change.
These  uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any  forward-looking
statements  made by, or on our behalf.  We  disclaim  any  obligation  to update
forward-looking statements.

The following discussion of the plan of operation,  financial condition, results
of  operations,  cash flows and  changes in  financial  position  of our Company
should be read in  conjunction  with our most recent  financial  statements  and
notes  appearing  elsewhere  in this  Form  10-Q and in our Form  10-K  filed on
November 25, 2008.

The  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm's report on the Company's
financial   statements  as  of  August  31,  2008,  include  a  "going  concern"
explanatory  paragraph  that  describes  substantial  doubt about the  Company's
ability to  continue  as a going  concern.  Management's  plans in regard to the
factors prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed below and also in Note
3 to the unaudited quarterly financial statements.

Plan of Operations

Over the past two (2)  years we have  continued  to build a  business  providing
travel packages that include professional, personalized service for visitors who
travels to British Columbia.  With the recent  international  market turmoil and
the  reduced  international  travel,  we  believe  that we need to  enlarge  our
business  activity.  We plan to continue our core  business  while seeking other
opportunities to build a profitable company.

We will continue our endeavors to create strategic  partnerships with travel and
special  event  companies  that will result in  reciprocal  advertising  on each
other's web site or other cross promotional print advertising.  The partnerships
that develop will enable us to grow our customer base and expand our business to
increasing  exposure to our website to the consumers  that view these  sponsors'
web sites.

Our marketing  strategy involves cross promotions with other travel agencies and
like-minded businesses to increase the awareness of services. Our website is our
main source of promotion and  facilitation for visitors booking their vacations.
We are re-working our website to better  facilitate our marketing and promotion.
We expect this to be completed within the next sixty (60) days.

We do not anticipate making any major purchases of capital assets, or conducting
any research and development.  Our current corporate  employee count is expected
to remain the same for the next year.

Principal Products and Services

We will continue to provide  all-inclusive  travel  packages with a personalized
assistant  to take care of every aspect of the trip.  The  personal  assistant's
primary focus is to bridge the language barrier which often creates  frustration
for travelers.  We cater to the expressed needs of our clients  providing an all
inclusive travel experience.

Liquidity

At November 30,  2008,  we had working  capital of $16,777,  compared to working
capital of $28,382 at August 31, 2008.  At November  30, 2008,  our total assets
consisted of cash of $23,776,  prepaid expenses of $292, net office equipment of


                                       3
<PAGE>

$1,480, net computer equipment of $2,076, and net website  development of $2,983
for a total of $30,607.  This compares with total assets at August 31, 2008 that
consisted of cash of $36,465,  prepaid expenses of $417, net office equipment of
$1,575, net computer equipment of $2,347, and net website  development of $3,372
for a total of $44,176.

At November 30, 2008, our total current liabilities were $7,291, which consisted
of  accounts  payable of $941 and  accrued  liabilities  of  $6,350.  This was a
decrease  from total  current  liabilities  of $8,500 at August 31, 2008,  which
consisted of accounts payable of $2,000 and accrued liabilities of $6,500.

Cash on hand is  currently  our only  sources of  liquidity.  We do not have any
lending  arrangements in place with banking or financial  institutions and we do
not anticipate that we will be able to secure these funding  arrangements in the
near future.

We recognized  $1,165 in revenues from operations during the three months ending
November 30, 2008.  Our short and long term  survival is dependent on sufficient
revenue resulting in a profitable  operation or funding from sales of securities
as necessary.

We  believe  our  existing  cash  balances  are  sufficient  to carry our normal
operations over the next three (3) months.  Our short and long-term  survival is
dependent on funding from sales of securities  as necessary or from  shareholder
loans,  and thus, to the extent that we require  additional funds to support our
operations or the expansion of our business,  we may attempt to sell  additional
equity  shares or issue debt.  Any sale of  additional  equity  securities  will
result in dilution  to our  stockholders.  Recent  events in  worldwide  capital
markets may make it more difficult for us to raise additional equity or capital.
There can be no  assurance  that  additional  financing,  if  required,  will be
available to us or on acceptable terms.

Results of Operations

For The Three Months Ended  November 30, 2008 Compared To The Three Months Ended
November 30, 2007.

We recognized  $1,165 in revenues from operational sales during the three months
ending  November 30, 2008  compared  with nil revenues  from  operational  sales
during the three months ending November 30, 2007.

For the three months ended  November 30, 2008,  operating  expenses  were $9,348
compared  to $23,270  during the three  months  ended  November  30,  2007.  The
decrease  of $13,922  was due to a decrease in our  operational  activities  and
professional  fees  over the  prior  period  compared  with  our  start up costs
incurred in the previous year.  Operating expenses during the three months ended
November 30, 2008 consisted of  professional  fees of $6,977,  amortization  and
depreciation  of $754,  office and  administration  costs of $875 and  marketing
costs of $742,  compared to  professional  fees of $11,722,  marketing  costs of
$10,329,   office  and  administration   costs  of  $967  and  amortization  and
depreciation costs of $252 for the three months ended November 30, 2007.

During the three months ended  November  30, 2008,  we  recognized a net loss of
$9,786 compared to a net loss of $23,270 for the three months ended November 30,
2007.  The decrease of $13,484 is due to an increase in revenue and the decrease
in the Company's  operational  activities and  professional  fees over the prior
period as discussed above.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sea 2 Sky currently does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
