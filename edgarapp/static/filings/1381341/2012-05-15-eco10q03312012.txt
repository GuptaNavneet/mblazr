1 - BUSINESS

Over the past 30 years,  the ecoTECH Energy Group, Inc. (the "Company") team has
developed  and refined the proprietary ecoPHASER thermal gasification technology
which enables  very clean-burning of  bio-mass and wastes.  We  are  in  various
stages of project development primarily  located in the United States of America
and in Canada. The Company is also pursuing international opportunities.

EcoTECH's  combined heat and power (CHP) technology  produces:  (i) electricity,
which can be channelled  to utilities  and  end-users  via the local  electrical
distribution system and (ii) heat which can be used to fuel a variety of "Green"
operating facilities.

Our  current  activities  are  focused  on  developing   several   strategically
positioned  CHP power  stations  in order to: (i) reduce the  reliance on fossil
fuels by providing a sustainable and  environmentally  friendly source of energy
and fuel products manufactured from local biomass feedstocks; (ii) meet specific
local  needs  for  decentralized  power,  while  reducing  the  cost of  biomass
transportation; (iii) assist communities meet federal and state renewable energy
and reduced  emissions  mandates;  and,  (iv) provide  local jobs and  community
development for the project communities.


2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying  unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of ecoTECH
have been prepared in accordance with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United  States of America and the rules of the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission,  and should be read in  conjunction  with the  audited  consolidated
financial  statements  and notes thereto  contained in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, filed with the SEC.

In the opinion of Management,  all  adjustments,  consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and results
of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The
results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily  indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year.  Notes to our  consolidated  financial
statements which substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been omitted.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods.

These estimates are based on  management's  best knowledge of current events and
actions the Company may undertake in the future.  Actual  results may ultimately
differ from those estimates. The significant estimates made by management relate
to the  estimation  of the  value of the  Company's  common  stock.  Changes  in
estimates are reported in earnings in the period in which they become known.

Comparative financial information

Certain  prior  year's  amounts  have been  reclassified  to conform to the 2012
presentation.

3 - GOING CONCERN

The accompanying  unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.

The  Company is a  development-stage  company  with no  revenues,  has a working
capital  deficit,  has net losses and used cash from operating  activities  from
Inception to March 31, 2012 of  $1,871,160.  At March 31, 2012,  the Company had
limited  available  capital.  These  matters raise  substantial  doubt about the
Company's  ability to continue  as a going  concern.  In view of these  matters,
realization  of  certain of the assets in the  accompanying  balance  sheets are
dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financing  requirements,  raise
additional capital, and the success of its future operations.

The  Company  requires  additional  capital of  approximately  $600,000  to $1.2
million to continue its  development  activities and provide working capital for
general corporate purposes for the next 12 months. In addition, the Company also
needs to obtain debt and equity  financing  to  construct  its current  projects
which range in cost from  approximately $4 million to $130 million  depending on
the scale of each project.

To the extent we are unable to meet our  operating  expenses we may borrow funds
from our current  management or other related  parties.  We will also attempt to
raise capital from private individuals or institutional investment equity and/or
debt funds for operating purposes.

The Company's management remains optimistic that some of our developing projects
will proceed in the  relatively  near future.  Future  project  revenues  and/or
sales, if any, which exceed operating  expenses and debt repayments will be used
to pay outstanding liabilities and expand operations.

Since we have no liquidity and have suffered losses, we depend to a great degree
on the ability to attract  external  financing  in order to conduct our business
activities  and to ensure  that we have  sufficient  cash on hand to expand  our
operations.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern.

There is no  assurance  that our capital  raising  plans will be  successful  in
obtaining sufficient funds to assure the eventual  profitability of the Company.
If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional  capital,  we may be
required  to reduce the scope of our planned  development,  which could harm our
business, financial condition and operating results.

These unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from these uncertainties.

Total property, plant and equipment, net         $   321,738      $    331,198
                                            ------------------------------------


Depreciation  expense for the period from  Inception to March 31, 2012,  and for
the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $221,757, $9,460 and $16,696,
respectively.

Acquisition of Land

On March 16, 2011 our wholly owned  subsidiary,  ecoTECH  Energy Group  (Canada)
Inc., completed its acquisition of a parcel of land located in McBride,  British
Columbia, for an aggregate purchase price of $256,725, of which $51,345 was paid
in cash along with a  $200,000  Canadian  dollar  vendor  mortgage  at 8% annual
interest.

The vendor  mortgage has a two year term expiring  March 15, 2013 and is secured
by the land. Combined interest and principal payments of $1,587 are due monthly,
with the balance due at expiration.  Interest expense for the three months ended
March 31, 2012 and 2011 was $3,947 and $667, respectively.

The Company is not current in servicing the note, and accordingly,  the note has
been  classified  as a  current  liability.  We are  working  on a  satisfactory
resolution  to bring the loan current or payout the  remaining  balance due. The
loss of this property would not have an adverse impact on our ability to operate
in the region.

6 - ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES

On February  5, 2009,  the  Company  borrowed  $99,137  from a  shareholder  for
operating capital, and agreed to repay the principal plus 10% annual interest in
90 days.  On  September  8, 2009 the note was  amended  to pay  interest  at 20%
interest per annum and matured in 90 days.  Upon default,  the note continues to
earn 20% per annum. On November 1, 2010, the note holder converted the principal
balance into 312,500 shares of private  company common stock  (pre-acquisition).
The  Company  has  paid  $9,707  of the  $27,959  interest  accrued  since  note
Inception. The remaining accrued interest of $18,252 remains to be paid at March
31, 2012.

On November 17,  2009,  the Company  borrowed  $34,151  from a  shareholder  for
operating  capital.  This  loan is  non-interest  bearing  and  does  not have a
specific  maturity date.  Management did not impute  interest as such amount was
not deemed significant.  As of March 31, 2012, the Company has not repaid any of
the principal balance.

From time to time,  the  directors and officers have loaned money to the Company
for general  operating  capital.  These loans are repaid in part or in full when
additional  capital is raised.  Due to the short-term nature of these loans, the
directors and or officers  agreed that they would not be interest  bearing,  and
are due upon demand.

Related party payables  represent  balances in accounts payable that are owed to
directors,   officers  and  shareholders.   These  payables  are  primarily  for
unreimbursed  travel  and  entertainment  expenses  incurred  on  behalf  of the
Company.   The  respective   parties  have  agreed  to  defer  these   payables,
interest-free, until additional capital is raised.

7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Operating Leases

The Company leased office space in Langley, British Columbia, Canada. The office
lease became effective on April 1, 2008 and was for a term of five years.  Basic
rent for the first  three  years was  $4,794.  Basic rent for the last two years
increased  approximately  7% to $5,113 per month.  In addition to basic rent and
applicable  taxes,  the Company was responsible for varying  operating  expenses
(HVAC, assessments, utilities and service charges, licenses and permits) as they
arose.

Due to delayed receipt of project approvals and sales deposits applicable to the
Company's  business  plans,  the office rent  payments  were in arrears prior to
December 31,  2011.  Subsequently,  in 2012 the lessor was no longer  willing to
allow rent  payments to be in arrears,  resulting  in the Company  vacating  the
premises on March 1, 2012,  Accordingly  at December 31, 2011, the Company wrote
off  its  leasehold   improvements   of  $139,600  and  applicable   accumulated
depreciation  of  $99,185  and has  recorded  an  accrued  provision  for future
settlement  costs of $79,655,  offset  partially  by a lease  deposit of $12,665
(note 5).

Actual office rent expense,  including all applicable taxes and operating costs,
for the period from  Inception  to March 31,  2012,  and the three  months ended
March 31, 2012 and 2011 were $349,136; $0 and $23,345, respectively.

upon demand.

interest-free, until additional capital is raised.

CURRENT PROJECTS

We are in different stages of project development  primarily located in the U.S.
and Canada.  The Company is  investigating  other  international  opportunities;
however, there have been no such activities to date.

McBride, British Columbia -- Aquaponics:

A combined  self-contained  $92 million  Aquaponic  Project,  in addition to our
power plant and  power-line  projects as noted below.  We have also  developed a
stand-alone  Aquaponics  project which combines a self-contained 5 megawatts per
hour biomass power plant, together with a fresh fish farming  (aqua-culture) and
a greenhouse vegetables facility hydroponics) using 100% organic processes.

The Company  has entered  into a 5 year  supply  purchase  contract  from one of
Canada's  largest  supermarket  chains,  to  purchase a minimum  $12  million of
organic  fish and  vegetables  per year.  The facility is designed to be able to
produce  revenues of  approximately  $55 million per year under full  commercial
operations.

Land has already been purchased by the Company, near the town of McBride,  which
has the  appropriate  zoning and for which we have obtained the necessary  water
permits.  The Company has  contracted  out the  preliminary  site  clearing and,
subject  to  receiving  project  financing,  is  in  the  position  to  commence
construction  in the summer of 2012; with  commercial  operations  projected for
2013.

We have  received  majority  debt  financing  offers  for this  project  and are
currently in negotiations  with equity  investors.  No final contracts have been
signed to date.

McBride, British Columbia - Power Generation:

The Company  currently is awaiting an Energy Purchase  Agreement ("EPA") for the
construction  and  operation of a $78 million,  24 megawatts  per hour  bio-mass
power plant and a $52 million 138 kilovolt power-line.  The EPA has been delayed
since September 2011, primarily due to the British Columbia Government's imposed
review of BC Hydro's proposed 3 year rate increases.

In February  2012, the BC Utilities  Commission  authorized a 7.07% interim rate
increase to BC Hydro,  rather than the BC Government's  suggested rate of 3.91%.
With the rate review completed,  management  believes that BC Hydro will be able
to move forward and issue the EPA in the near future.

The Company  intends to  purchase  additional  land in the McBride  area for the
power plant with right of ways to be  established  for the power  lines,  if and
when the EPA has been finalized and given the availability of funds.

Ambato, Ecuador

A $6 million Garbage to Concrete  (Garcrete) system for Ambato,  with additional
orders  expected to be received for five additional  Garcrete  systems for other
locations in Ecuador.

In  addition,  an  interior  location  is being  sought by the  Ecuador  federal
government  for a 72 megawatts  per hour W2E CHP (Waste to Energy  Combined Heat
and Power)  facility,  quoted by Excelsior  Recycle Concepts Inc. (our sales and
marketing agents) on behalf of ecoTECH.

These  facilities  will utilize the  Company's  ecoPHASER  thermal  gasification
technology  and will  burn  municipal  waste in order to  reduce  the  country's
reliance on landfills.

It is our  understanding  that these projects have been delayed due to a pending
review in Ecuador by the  government in respect of certain  local  circumstances
which are unrelated to Excelsior or to ecoTECH.  The pending  government  review
has delayed the completion of final  contracts and receipt of purchase  deposits
to ecoTECH.

Other Projects in Development

The Company is  investigating  several other projects,  including a 24 megawatts
per hour  bio-mass  power plant  project for an  operating  gold mine in Fiji, a
smaller  Aquaponics  project in the lower  mainland of British  Columbia,  and a
hybrid  power/torrefaction  facility  for fiber  export to Asia from  Whitehall,
Montana.

ecoTECH has been  accepted as a  registered  supplier  to the US  Department  of
Defense. The Company, under a Current Request for Proposal, has entered into the
bidding for the Fort Bliss - Net Zero Project.

We are pleased to advise that  Lockheed  Martin's M2 division  has offered to be
our Engineering  Procurement and  Construction  (EPC) contractor on US projects,
both for power and military base projects.

Results of Operations and Development Expenditures

ecoTECH is a development-stage  Company as we have had no revenues or sales from
November 28, 2007  ("Inception")  through  March 31, 2012.  The Company does not
anticipate  recognizing sales or revenues from its activities in the next six to
nine months.

General and administrative  expenditures decreased to $199,413 from $428,586 for
the three  months  ended March 31,  2012 and 2011,  respectively.  The  $229,173
decrease is primarily due to lower operating expenditures reflecting our limited
capital resources,  combined with reductions in certain rent obligations for the
three month's ended March 31, 2012.

Research and development  expenditures increased to $63,318 from $12,516 for the
three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011,  respectively.  The $50,802 increase
reflects a higher allocation of costs pertaining to projects under development.

Interest  expense  increased  to $13,766  from $9,431 for the three months ended
March 31, 2012 and 2011  respectively,  due to the  mortgage  applicable  to the
property purchased in March 2011.

The Company did not sell any  flow-through  shares in the first quarter of 2012.
Accordingly  the income tax benefit was $0 compared  with  $11,582 for the three
months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 respectively.

We do not anticipate having to pay income taxes in the upcoming years due to our
accumulated  net operating  loss carry forwards for tax purposes of 2,666,609 as
of December 31, 2011.

During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company  recognized a net loss
of $276,497  compared to $438,951  during the three months ended March 31, 2011.
The decrease of $162,454  was a result of the  $229,173  decrease in general and
administrative  expense offset  partially by a $50,802  increase in research and
development, a $4,335 increase in interest expense and a decrease in tax benefit
of $11,582.



Capital and Liquidity

The following table provides selected financial data as of March 31, 2012:

                                                              March 31, 2012

Cash and cash equivalents                                       $          721
Total current assets                                                     3,852
Total assets                                                           330,604
Total liabilities                                                    4,002,050
Stockholders' deficit                                               (3,671,446)


During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company received $8,282 in net
cash from the sale of its  common  stock.  These  proceeds  are  being  used for
operating and general and administrative expenses to sustain the Company through
its  development  stage until it establishes  profitable  operations or receives
cash from the issuance of additional common stock.

Net cash used in operating activities for the period from Inception to March 31,
2012,  was  $1,871,160,  consisting  primarily of our net losses of  $36,433,618
offset by  non-cash  expenses  of  $28,181,593  of stock  compensation  expense,
$221,757 in  depreciation,  $541,131  for  accretion  of  beneficial  conversion
feature, $700,535 of loss on extinguishment of convertible debt, financing costs
of $1,389,908,  an increase in accounts payable of $1,157,689 and an increase in
accrued liabilities of $2,337,849.

Net cash used in operating  activities decreased to $21,379 from $29,778 for the
three  months  ended  March 31,  2012 and 2011  respectively.  The  decrease  is
primarily due to the reduced operating activities as noted above.

Net cash used in investing activities for the period from Inception to March 31,
2012,  was  $382,810,  which  consisted  of  purchases  of  property,  plant and
equipment,  less $8,510 cash received in consolidation.  In March 2011,  ecoTECH

                                       18
<PAGE>

Canada acquired land located in McBride,  British  Columbia.  The purchase price
was  $256,725,  of  which  approximately  20  percent  was paid in a cash use of
$51,345,  and the balance by a non-cash vendor financed mortgage for a term of 2
years at an interest rate of 8%.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the period from Inception to March
31, 2012, was $2,233,790  which consisted of $214,049 in proceeds from notes and
loans payable (net of  repayments)  from related  parties;  $685,020 in proceeds
from  the  sale  of  common  stock;  $222,286  in  proceeds  from  the  sale  of
flow-through  shares;  $1,137,581  in  proceeds  from  the  sale of  convertible
debentures,  less $24,071 in payments on convertible  debentures;  and $1,075 in
principal payments on the mortgage.

We had minimal  cash on hand of $721 and $1,134 at March 31,  2012 and  December
31, 2011, respectively.

To the extent we are unable to meet our operating expenses,  we may borrow funds
from our current  management or other related parties.  The Company has borrowed
$12,667  (net of  repayments)  during the three  months ended March 31, 2012 and
repaid  $9,345  during  the three  months  ended  March 31,  2011.  The  Company
continues  to  seek  new  capital  from  private  individuals  or  institutional
investment  equity  and/or debt funds for  operating  purposes.  Future  project
revenues  and/or  sales,  if any,  which  exceed  operating  expenses  and  debt
repayments, will be used to pay outstanding liabilities and expand operations.

We are continually  attempting to raise debt and equity financing applicable for
our developing projects.

Since we have no liquidity and have suffered losses, we depend to a great degree
on the ability to attract  external  financing  in order to conduct our business
activities  and to ensure  that we have  sufficient  cash on hand to expand  our
operations.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern.

Additional  information  with  respect  to our  ability to  continue  as a going
concern is disclosed in Item 1, Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements,
and with respect to commitments and contingencies is disclosed in Item 1, Note 7
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-Q.

If we  are  unable  to  raise  additional  capital  from  conventional  sources,
including increases in related party loans and/or additional sales of additional
stock, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.

Even if we are able to continue our operations,  the failure to obtain financing
could have a substantial  adverse effect on our business and financial  results.
We have no commitments  to provide us with  financing in the future,  other than
described  above. We may be required to seek additional  capital by selling debt
or equity  securities,  selling  assets,  or otherwise be required to bring cash
flows in balance when it approaches a condition of cash insufficiency.  The sale
of additional equity securities, if accomplished,  may result in dilution to our
existing  shareholders.  We  cannot  assure  you,  however,  that debt or equity
financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting  periods.  These estimates are based on  management's  best
knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.

Actual  results may  ultimately  differ from those  estimates.  The  significant
estimates  made by  management  relate  to the  estimation  of the  value of the
Company's   common  stock  and  income  tax  benefit  related  to  the  sale  of
flow-through shares. Changes in estimates are reported in earnings in the period
in which they become known.

We  believe  the  following  critical   accounting  policies  involve  our  more
significant  judgments and estimates  used in the  preparation  of our financial
statements.




                                       19
<PAGE>

Share-Based Payments

The Company  accounts for stock issued to employees and directors  under ASC 718
"Compensation - Stock  Compensation."  Under ASC 718,  stock-based  compensation
cost to employees  is measured at the grant date,  based on the  estimated  fair
value of the award,  and is recognized as expense over the employee's  requisite
vesting period. No stock options are currently outstanding.

The  Company  measures  compensation  expense for its  non-employee  stock-based
compensation  under ASC 505  "Equity."  The fair value of the  option  issued or
committed  to be issued is used to measure  the  transaction.  The fair value is
measured  at the  value of the  Company's  common  stock  on the  date  that the
commitment  for  performance  by  the  counterparty  has  been  reached  or  the
counterparty's  performance  is complete or the award is fully vested.  The fair
value of the equity  instrument is charged directly to stock-based  compensation
expense and credited to common stock and additional paid-in-capital.

Prior to November  12,  2010,  there was no public  market for ecoTECH  Canada's
common stock, and accordingly,  the amount of the compensatory  charge was based
on  prevailing  sales  price  of the  stock  since  Inception  under  which  the
determination of stock-based  compensation  was inherently  highly uncertain and
subjective,  and involved the  application  of discounts  deemed  appropriate to
reflect the lack of marketability  of the Company's  securities - which have not
been considered in the basis for calculation.  If the Company had made different
assumptions,  its stock-based  compensation  expense and relative net loss could
have been significantly different.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  The costs of materials
and  equipment  that will be acquired  or  constructed  for project  development
activities,  and that have alternative future uses, both in project development,
marketing  or sales,  will be  capitalized  classified  as  property,  plant and
equipment and depreciated over their estimated  useful lives. To date,  research
costs   include   engineering   expenses   related  to  the   Company's   future
waste-to-energy facilities, and all have been expensed when incurred.

Foreign Currency Translations

The Company uses the Canadian dollar as its functional currency of its operating
subsidiary  ecoTECH  Canada.  Unless  otherwise  noted,  for the purpose of this
report, the financial statements of the ecoTECH Canada have been translated into
United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830,  "Foreign  Currency  Matters,"
using historical rates for fixed assets and year-end exchange rates in effect on
the balance sheet dates for all other assets and liabilities,  average, specific
or  historical  exchange  rates as  applicable  in  effect  for the  period  for
revenues,  costs,  and expenses,  and historical  exchange rates for shareholder
equity (deficit).

Translation  adjustments  resulting from translation of balances from functional
to reporting  currency are accumulated as a separate  component of shareholders'
deficit and as a component of comprehensive loss in the accompanying  statements
of  operations.  Transaction  gains and losses are reported in the statements of
operations and comprehensive  loss. To date, no transaction gains or losses have
been experienced.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

None.


ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are a small  development-stage  reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of
the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information  required under
this item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEEDURES


Management's Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management,  with the participation of our principal executive and financial
officers,  has  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures  in ensuring  that the  information  required to be  disclosed in our
filings  under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended,  is recorded,
processed,  summarized  and reported  within the time  periods  specified in the
Securities and Exchange  Commission's  rules and forms,  including ensuring that
such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on such evaluation,
our  principal  executive  and  financial  officers  have  concluded  that  such
disclosure  controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2012 (the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible  for  establishing  and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The internal control process
has been  designed,  under our  supervision,  to  provide  reasonable  assurance
regarding the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of the
Company's  financial  statements for external  reporting  purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management  conducted  an  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of  the  Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012 including (i) the
control  environment,  (ii) risk  assessment,  (iii)  control  activities,  (iv)
information and  communication,  and (v)  monitoring,  based on the framework in
Internal Control - Integrated  Framework,  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations  of the  Treadway  Commission  ("COSO").  As of  March  31,  2012,
management has  determined  that the Company's  internal  control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2012 was not effective, as more fully described below.
This was due to the size of the  deficiencies  that  existed  in the  design  or
operation  of our internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  adversely
affected  our  internal  controls  and that  may be  considered  to be  material
weaknesses.  The matters  involving  internal  controls and procedures  that the
Company's management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of
the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board were: (1) lack of formal review
process for our financial information and related disclosures;  (2) insufficient
written  policies and procedures  for  accounting  and financial  reporting with
respect  to the  requirements  and  application  of US GAAP  and SEC  disclosure
requirements;  (3)  inadequate  segregation  of duties  consistent  with control
objectives; and (4) lack of policies and procedures relating to issuances of our
common stock.  The  aforementioned  material  weaknesses  were identified by the
Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial
statements as of March 31, 2012 and  communicated the matters to our management.
Management  believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not affect
the Company's financial results.

Management believes that preparing and implementing  sufficient written policies
and checklists will remedy the following  material  weaknesses (i)  insufficient
written  policies and procedures  for  accounting  and financial  reporting with
respect  to the  requirements  and  application  of US GAAP  and SEC  disclosure
requirements;  and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and
reporting processes.  Further, management believes that the hiring of additional
personnel who have the technical  expertise and knowledge  will result in proper
segregation  of  duties  and  provide  more  checks  and  balances   within  the
department.  Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to
support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the  department  occur.
This coupled with the appointment of additional  outside  directors will greatly
decrease  any control and  procedure  issues the  Company may  encounter  in the
future.

As is the case  with  many  companies  of  similar  size,  we  currently  lack a
segregation of duties in the accounting department.  Until our operations expand
and additional cash flow is generated from operations, a complete segregation of
duties within our accounting function will not be possible.

All  internal  control  systems,  no matter  how well  designed,  have  inherent
limitations.  Therefore,  even those  systems  determined  to be  effective  can
provide  only   reasonable   assurance  with  respect  to  financial   statement
preparations  and  presentations.   Also,   projections  of  any  evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

This  annual  report  does not include an  attestation  report of the  Company's
registered  public  accounting  firm regarding  internal  control over financial
reporting.  Management's  report was not subject to attestation by the Company's

                                       21
<PAGE>

registered  public accounting firm pursuant to permanent rules of the Securities
and Exchange  Commission  that permit the Company to provide  only  management's
report in this annual report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the three months ended March 31, 2012, there were no significant  changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and  15d-15(f)   under  the  Exchange  Act,  or  in  other  factors  that  could
significantly affect these controls subsequent to the evaluation date.

material in relation to the Company's consolidated financial position


ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Not Applicable to Small Reporting Companies.


ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

In February  2012,  the Company  raised $1,006  through the sale of 3,211 common
shares for cash at $0.31 per share,  less  commission of $151 to individuals and
entities known to the Company.

In March  2012,  the Company  raised  $7,276  through the sale of 29,445  common
shares for cash at $0.25 per share,  less  commissions  of $1,091 to individuals
and entities known to the Company.

The  Company  has used the funds  from sale of its  securities  to  support  its
ongoing operations.

Exemption From Registration Claimed

All of the above sales by the Company of its  unregistered  securities were made
by the Company in reliance upon Rule 506 of Regulation D of the  Securities  Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").  All of the  individuals  and/or  entities
that purchased the unregistered securities were primarily existing shareholders,
known  to  the  Company  and  its  management,   through  pre-existing  business
relationships,   as  long  standing  business  associates  and  employees.   All
purchasers  were  provided  access  to  all  material  information,  which  they
requested,  and all  information  necessary to verify such  information and were
afforded access to management of the Company in connection with their purchases.
All  purchasers of the  unregistered  securities  acquired such  securities  for
investment and not with a view toward distribution, acknowledging such intent to
the Company.  All certificates or agreements  representing  such securities that
were issued contained  restrictive legends,  prohibiting further transfer of the
certificates or agreements representing such securities, without such securities
either being first  registered  or  otherwise  exempt from  registration  in any
further resale or disposition.
