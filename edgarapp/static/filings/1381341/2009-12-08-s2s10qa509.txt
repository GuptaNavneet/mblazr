EXPLANATORY NOTE
----------------
This Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment") on Form 10-Q/A to the Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q of Sea 2 Sky Corporation  (the "Company") for the period ended May 31,
2009,  which was filed with the Securities  and Exchange  Commission on July 15,
2009, is being filed for the purpose of correcting the accounting treatment used
to  record  common  stock  shares  issued  to five (5) new  Directors  (the "New
Directors")during March 2009.

This Report has been amended to reverse $2,360,000 of previously  recorded stock
compensation  expense in excess of par value  ($0.001 per share) for  40,000,000
shares of SSKY common stock issued to five (5) new directors as an incentive for
joining the Company with their new business plan it  alternative  energy.  Under
guidelines  provided  by FASB  issued  ASC  805-10-65-1  (formerly  SFAS No. 141
(revised 2007),  "Business  Combinations"  ("SFAS 141R") which replaces SFAS No.
141, "Business Combination"), these New Directors were determined, subsequent to
the initial filing of this Form 10-Q, to have effected a change in control since
the New Directors owned  approximately 47% of the outstanding  shares,  and they
controlled  the board of directors  and intended  operations.  Accordingly,  the
share transactions should be accounted for as a recapitalization and no goodwill
recorded.  As a result,  stock  issued  to the New  Directors  should  have been
recorded at par value ($0.001 per share)of $40,000,  as there was no transfer of
identifiable assets which would have been recorded at their historical costs.

Items amended include:

ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.

Pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended
(the  "Exchange  Act"),  we  have  filed  the  certifications  required  by Rule
13a-14(a) or 15d-14(a) of the Exchange Act.

                      NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)


NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

Sea 2 Sky  Corporation  (the  "Company"  or "Sea 2 Sky") is a  development-stage
company  and was  incorporated  in the state of Nevada,  on  November  16,  2005
("Inception").  The  Company's  fiscal year end is August 31st.  The Company was
initially  established to provide travel related  services to tourists in Canada
and other  countries.  Due to an economic  downturn,  the Company  abandoned its
travel-related  services during the first half of fiscal year 2008. As a result,
assets and expenses related to the travel business have been  reclassified  from
current  operations  to that of  discontinued  operations  for proper  financial
presentation.  The total  net loss  from  these  discontinued  operations  since
inception is $18,241.

The  Company  has  transitioned  from its  initial  business  focus to that of a
world-wide renewable energy provider, and is entering an emerging opportunity in
the  alternative  fuel,  biomass sector of the forest  industry.  The Company is
currently  seeking  acquisition  rights to biomass  supplies around the world so
that   we   may   begin   the   manufacturing   and   global   distribution   of
environmentally-friendly alternative fuel sources.


Plan of Operations

In order to fully  evaluate the  emerging  opportunity,  the Company  intends to
proceed in two  stages.  The first  stage is to  establish  itself in the supply
chain marketplace by meeting and finalizing various memorandums of understanding
with First Nations peoples who wish to deal with the Company.  Concurrently, the
Company will meet with various pellet plant  manufacturers to determine the best
fit for the Company's needs for plants as well as continue to pursue markets for
the pellets  produced.  Once this  preliminary  evaluation is done , the Company
anticipates  placing a deposit on its first plant with full production from that
plant occurring late in 2009. Thereafter, upon production and having the ability
to go to the market with its pellet  product,  the  Company  will  consider  the
development of further plants as demand increases.  The Company intends to raise
$1,000,000 to fund its initial requirement using its equity securities.

Biomass Opportunity-Sources

To  provide  new  materials  for  increases  in demand  for  pellets,  finding a
significant source of forest residue in a stable country is important.  A recent
government study, concluded that the combination of the large portion of British
Columbia's Pine Forests having been devastated by an infestation of the Mountain
Pine Beetle,  sawdust and shavings  from sawmill  operations,  forestry  logging
slash, trees unusable for the production of construction  lumber,  residues from
sustainable  harvesting and improved forest practices can generate up to a total
of  approximately  28  million  tons of  biomass  per year for the next 15 to 20
years.  With only about 3 million  tons per year  currently  being  utilized  to
produce pellets, the potential is huge.

================================================================================

While the Pine  Beetle  infestation  is  devastating  to the local  economy,  it
represents  the largest pool of renewable  energy in the form of wood pellets in
North America.


Competition

The competitors of the Company include:

     -    Shaw Resources producing Eastern Embers Wood Pellet Product
     -    Premium  Pellet  Ltd.  (est.  1998) is based  in  Vanderhoof,  British
          Columbia, Canada.
     -    Energex Pellet Fuel - Lac-Megantic, Quebec
     -    Pinnacle Pellet Inc - Quesnel, British Columbia

The above are just four of many companies who manufacture and sell wood pellets.


The Market

Pellets are most widely used in Sweden - mainly as an  alternative  to oil-fired
central  heating.  In Austria,  the leading  market for pellet  central  heating
furnaces  (relative  to its  population),  it is  estimated  that 2/3 of all new
domestic  heating  furnaces  are pellet  burners.  In Italy,  a large market for
automatically-fed pellet stoves has developed.

The European  Union and other  countries now legally  mandate the use of biomass
sources of energy for domestic and industrial use. For example,  in some regions
of  Austria,  80% of new homes  already  use  biomass  for  heating,  and the UK
building code for sustainable  housing mandates 100% of new homes by 2012 to use
renewable  technologies.  Wood  pellet  biomass  is the most  accepted  and most
feasible source of this energy and demand for wood pellets in Europe is forecast
to increase up to 10 fold by 2020.

In the United States,  the current  administration has announced plans to double
the use of renewable  biomass energy  starting 2009 and the Department of Energy
is issuing  over $200  million  in  requests  from  Industry  for small  biomass
projects, and another $80 Billion for larger federal institutional procurement.


Development-Stage Company

The accompanying  financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 7 "Accounting and Reporting by

principles  generally  accepted  in the  Unites  States  of  America  have  been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  In the opinion of
management, all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation of
these  financial  statements  have been included.  Such  adjustments  consist of
normal recurring adjustments.

Operating  results for the three and nine month periods ended May 31, 2009   are
not  necessarily  indicative  of the results  that may be expected  for the full
fiscal year ending August 31, 2009.

The  accompanying  condensed  interim  financial  statements  should  be read in
conjunction with the audited financial  statements of the Company for the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2008.


Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting  periods.  These estimates are based on  management's  best
knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future.
Actual results may ultimately  differ from those estimates.  These estimates are
reviewed  on an ongoing  basis and as  adjustments  become  necessary,  they are
reported in earnings in the period in which they become known.


Fair Value Measurements

Effective  August 1, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS 157, except as it applies to
the nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial  liabilities subject to FSP SFAS 157-2.
SFAS 157  clarifies  that fair value is an exit price,  representing  the amount
that would be received  to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a liability  in an
orderly  transaction  between  market  participants.  As such,  fair  value is a
market-based  measurement  that should be determined  based on assumptions  that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for
considering such assumptions, SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier value hierarchy,
which  prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation  methodologies  in measuring
fair value:

   Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for
             identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
   Level 2 - Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in
             the marketplace.
   Level 3 - Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market
             activity.

The fair  value  hierarchy  also  requires  an  entity  to  maximize  the use of
observable  inputs and minimize the use of  unobservable  inputs when  measuring
fair value. Cash (Level 1), accounts  receivable,  other  receivables,  accounts
payable,  accrued liabilities,  due to stockholders and convertible loan payable
(Level 2) are reflected in the interim  balance sheet at carrying  value,  which
approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

================================================================================

<PAGE>

The carrying value of the Company's financial  instruments,  consisting of cash,
prepaid  expenses,  accounts payable and accrued  liabilities  approximate their
fair value due to the short-term maturity of such instruments.  Unless otherwise
noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant
interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial statements.


Foreign Currency Translations

The  Company  uses the  Canadian  dollar and the U.S.  dollar as its  functional
currency.  The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. All transactions
initiated in other  currencies are re-measured  into the functional  currency as
follows:

     i)   Monetary  assets and  liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at
          the balance sheet date,
     ii)  Non-monetary  assets and liabilities,  and equity at historical rates,
          and
     iii) Revenue and expense  items at the average rate of exchange  prevailing
          during the period.

Gains and losses on  re-measurement  are included in determining  net income for
the period.

Translation  of  balances  from  the  functional  currency  into  the  reporting
currency is  conducted  as  follows:  i) Assets and  liabilities  at the rate of
exchange in effect at the balance sheet date,  ii) Equity at  historical  rates,
and iii) Revenue and expense  items at the average  rate of exchange  prevailing
during the period.

Translation  adjustments  resulting from translation of balances from functional
to reporting  currency are accumulated as a separate  component of shareholders'
equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss.


Stock-Based Payments

The Company  accounts for stock options issued to employees and directors  under
SFAS  No.  123(R),   "Share-Based  Payment".  Under  SFAS  123(R),   share-based
compensation  cost to  employees  is measured  at the grant  date,  based on the
estimated  fair  value of the  award,  and is  recognized  as  expense  over the
employee's requisite vesting period.

The  Company  measures  compensation  expense for its  non-employee  stock-based
compensation  under the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 96-18" Accounting for Equity Instruments that
are  Issued to Other  Than  Employees  for  Acquiring,  or in  Conjunction  with
Selling,  Goods or Services ". The fair value of the option  issued or committed
to be issued is used to measure the  transaction,  as this is more reliable than
the fair value of the services received. The fair value is measured at the value
of the Company's common stock on the date that the commitment for performance by
the counterparty has been reached or the counterparty's performance is complete.
The fair  value of the equity  instrument  is charged  directly  to  stock-based
compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital.


Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income". SFAS 130
requires  that the  components  and total  amounts  of  comprehensive  income be
displayed in the financial statements.  Comprehensive income includes net income
and all changes in equity  during a period that arises from  non-owner  sources,
such as  foreign  currency  items and  unrealized  gains and  losses on  certain
investments in equity securities.


Earnings or Loss per Share

The Company  accounts for  earnings or loss per share  pursuant to SFAS No. 128,
"Earnings per Share," which requires  disclosure on the financial  statements of
"basic" and "diluted" earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share
is computed by dividing  net income  (loss) by the  weighted  average  number of
common shares  outstanding  for the year.  Diluted  earnings (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted  average number of common
shares  outstanding plus potentially  dilutive  securities  outstanding for each
year.  At  May  31,  2009,  the  Company  had no  stock  equivalents  that  were
anti-dilutive and excluded in the earnings per share computation.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated
useful  lives.  The  Company  uses the  straight-line  method  of  depreciation.
Expenditures  for  maintenance  and repairs which do not  materially  extend the
useful lives of property and equipment are charged to earnings. When property or
equipment  is sold or otherwise  disposed  of, the cost and related  accumulated
depreciation are removed from the respective accounts with the resulting gain or
loss reflected in earnings.

Website   development   costs   representing   capitalized   costs  of   design,
configuration,  coding,  installation  and testing of the  Company's  website is
capitalized  until initial  implementation.  Upon  implementation,  the asset is
amortized  to expense  over its  estimated  useful life of three years using the
straight-line  method.  In February 2009, the original  website had no remaining
useful life and was  expensed.  A new website was  developed  in February  2009.
Accumulated   amortization   at  May  31,   2009  was  $111.   Ongoing   website
post-implementation  costs of  operation,  including  training  and  application
maintenance, will be charged to expense as incurred.

As a result of the headquarters  moving to Washington,  an immaterial  amount of
office  equipment and furniture was written-off to  depreciation  expense at May
31, 2009.  The cost to move the items would have  exceeded the net book value of
approximately $3,000.


Income Taxes

The Company has adopted the Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 109
-  "Accounting  for Income  Taxes" (SFAS 109).  SFAS 109 requires the use of the
asset and liability  method of  accounting of income taxes.  Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences  attributable to temporary  differences  between
the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their  respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are measured
using  enacted  tax rates  expected  to apply to taxable  income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September  2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board ("FASB")  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"
("FAS 157"). The provisions of FAS 157 define fair value,  establish a framework
for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expand
disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP
FAS 157-2  which  delayed  the  effective  date of FAS 157 for all  nonfinancial
assets  and  nonfinancial  liabilities,  except  those  that are  recognized  or
disclosed at fair value in the  financial  statements  on a recurring  basis (at
least annually). This FSP partially deferred the effective date of Statement 157
to fiscal years  beginning  after November 15, 2008, and interim  periods within
those  fiscal  years for items within the scope of this FSP. The adoption of the
remaining  provisions  of FAS 157  previously  deferred by FSP FAS 157-2 did not
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows.


In  December  2007,  the FASB  issued  ASC  805-10-65-1  (formerly  SFAS No. 141
(revised 2007),  "Business  Combinations"  ("SFAS 141R") which replaces SFAS No.
141,  "Business  Combination").  ASC 805-10-65-1  establishes the principles and
requirements  for how an acquirer:  (1) recognizes and measures in its financial
statements the identifiable assets acquired,  the liabilities  assumed,  and any
noncontrolling  interest  in the  acquiree;  (2)  recognizes  and  measures  the
goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase;
and (3)  discloses  the  business  combination.  This  Statement  applies to all
transactions  in which an  entity  obtains  control  of one or more  businesses,
including   transactions  that  occur  without  the  transfer  of  any  type  of
consideration.  ASC  805-10-65-1  was effective on a  prospective  basis for all
business  combinations  on or after  January 1, 2009,  with the exception of the
accounting  for  valuation   allowances  on  deferred  taxes  and  acquired  tax
contingencies. See Note 5 for impact.


In  December  2007,  the FASB  issued  Financial  Accounting  Standard  No. 160,
"Non-controlling Interests in Financial Statements--an amendment of ARB No. 51".
SFAS 160 requires that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary be reported as
equity  and  the  amount  of  net  income   specifically   attributable  to  the
non-controlling  interest be  identified in the  financial  statements.  It also

================================================================================

<PAGE>

calls  for  consistency  in the  manner of  reporting  changes  in the  parent's
ownership  interest and requires fair value  measurement of any  non-controlling
equity  investment  retained in a  deconsolidation.  SFAS 160 was adopted by the
Company  effective  January 1, 2009 and did not have an effect on the  Company's
financial statements.

In December  2007,  the FASB  ratified  Emerging  Issues Task  Force's  ("EITF")
consensus conclusion on EITF 07-01, "Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements".
EITF  07-01  defines   collaborative   arrangements  and  establishes  reporting
requirements   for   transactions   between   participants  in  a  collaborative
arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties. Under
this conclusion,  a participant to a collaborative  arrangement  should disclose
information about the nature and purpose of its collaborative arrangements,  the
rights and  obligations  under the  collaborative  arrangements,  the accounting
policy for collaborative  arrangements,  and the income statement classification
and  amounts   attributable  to  transactions  arising  from  the  collaborative
arrangement  between  participants  for  each  period  an  income  statement  is
presented.  EITF 07-01 is effective for interim or annual  reporting  periods in
fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15, 2008 and  requires  retrospective
application to all prior periods  presented for all  collaborative  arrangements
existing as of the effective date. While we have not yet completed our analysis,
we do not anticipate the  implementation of EITF 07-01 to have a material impact
on our financial statements.

In March  2008,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  161,  "Disclosures  about  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,  an amendment of FASB  Statement No. 133".
SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133, "Accounting
for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities"  ("SFAS 133"), by requiring
enhanced  disclosures  about how and why an entity uses derivative  instruments,
how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS
133 and its related interpretations,  and how derivative instruments and related
hedged items affect an entity's financial position,  financial performance,  and
cash flows.  SFAS 161 requires  qualitative  disclosures  about  objectives  and
strategies  for using  derivatives,  quantitative  disclosures  about fair value
amounts of, and gains and losses on,  derivative  instruments,  and  disclosures
about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161
was  adopted by the  Company as of January 1, 2009 and did not have an impact on
the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial positions.

In April  2008,  the FASB issued  Emerging  Issues  Task Force  ("EITF")  07-05,
"Determining  whether  an  Instrument  (or  Embedded  Feature)  Is Indexed to an
Entity's Own Stock". EITF 07-5 applies to any freestanding financial instruments
or embedded features that have the  characteristics of a derivative,  as defined
by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
and to any freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an
entity's own common  stock.  EITF 07-05 is effective  for  financial  statements
issued for fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  2008.  The Company is
currently  evaluating  the impact of EITF 07-5, but does not expect the adoption
of this  pronouncement  will have a material  impact on its financial  position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2008,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB")  issued FASB
Staff  Position  (FSP")  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")
142-3,  "Determination  of the  Useful  Life of  Intangible  Assets"  ("FSP SFAS
142-3").  FSP SFAS  142-3  amends  the  factors  that  should be  considered  in
developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of
a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets"  ("SFAS  142").  The  intent of this FSP is to improve  the  consistency
between the useful life of a recognized  intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the
period of expected  cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007),  Business  Combinations,"  and other U.S.
generally accepted accounting  principles ("GAAP").  FSP SFAS 142-3 is effective
for financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning after December 15,
2008,  and interim  periods  within  those fiscal  years.  The  requirement  for
determining  useful lives must be applied  prospectively  to  intangible  assets
acquired  after  the  effective  date and the  disclosure  requirements  must be
applied  prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent
to, the effective date.  Early adoption is prohibited.  The Company is currently
reviewing the effect,  if any, the proposed  guidance will have on its financial
statements.

In May 2008,  the FASB issued  Statement  No. 162,  "The  Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted  Accounting  Principles"  ("SFAS 162"). The new standard is intended to
improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy,
for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements
that are  presented  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles ("GAAP") for nongovernmental  entities. Prior to the issuance of SFAS

================================================================================
Sea 2 Sky                                                                Page 12

<PAGE>

162, GAAP  hierarchy was defined in the American  Institute of Certified  Public
Accountants  ("AICPA")  Statement  on  Auditing  Standards  ("SAS")  No. 69, The
Meaning of Present  Fairly in  Conformity  With  Generally  Accepted  Accounting
Principles.  SAS 69 has been  criticized  because it is  directed to the auditor
rather than the entity. SFAS 162 addresses these issues by establishing that the
GAAP hierarchy  should be directed to entities because it is the entity (not its
auditor) that is responsible for selecting  accounting  principles for financial
statements  that are  presented in conformity  with GAAP.  SFAS 162 is effective
November 15, 2008 and is only effective for nongovernmental entities; therefore,
the GAAP  hierarchy  will  remain in SAS 69 for  state  and  local  governmental
entities and federal governmental  entities. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of SFAS 162, but does not expect the  adoption of this  pronouncement
will have a material impact on its financial position,  results of operations or
cash flows.

In May 2008,  FASB issued  SFAS No. 163,  "Accounting  for  Financial  Guarantee
Insurance  Contracts - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60". SFAS No. 163
provides  enhanced  guidance on the  recognition  and  measurement to be used to
account for premium revenue and claim liabilities and related disclosures and is
limited to financial guarantee insurance (and reinsurance) contracts,  issued by
enterprises  included within the scope of FASB Statement No. 60, "Accounting and
Reporting  by  Insurance  Enterprises".  SFAS  No.  163  also  requires  that an
insurance  enterprise  recognize a claim  liability prior to an event of default
when there is evidence  that  credit  deterioration  has  occurred in an insured
financial obligation.  SFAS No. 163 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years and interim  periods  beginning  after 15 December  2008,  with
early  application  not permitted.  The adoption of SFAS No. 163 did not have an
impact on the Company's financial statements.

In  May,  2008,  FASB  issued  FSP  Accounting  Principles  Board  ("APB")  14-1
"Accounting for Convertible  Debt  Instruments  That May Be Settled in Cash upon
Conversion  (Including  Partial Cash Settlement)" ("FSP APB 14-1"). FSP APB 14-1
clarifies that  convertible  debt  instruments  that may be settled in cash upon
conversion (including partial cash settlement) are not addressed by paragraph 12
of APB Opinion No. 14,  "Accounting  for  Convertible  Debt and Debt Issued with
Stock Purchase Warrants."  Additionally,  FSP APB 14-1 specifies that issuers of
such  instruments  should  separately  account  for  the  liability  and  equity
components  in a manner  that will  reflect  the  entity's  nonconvertible  debt
borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent  periods.  FSP APB
14-1 is effective for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning
after  December 15, 2008, and interim  periods within those fiscal years.  Early
adoption is not  permitted.  The Company is currently  reviewing the effect,  if
any; the proposed guidance will have on its financial statements.

In June 2008,  the FASB issued FSP Emerging  Issue Task Force ("EITF") Issue No.
03-6-1,   "Determining   Whether  Instruments  Granted  in  Share-Based  Payment
Transactions Are Participating  Securities" ("FSP EITF 03-6-1"). FSP EITF 03-6-1
provides that unvested  share-based payment awards that contain  non-forfeitable
rights to  dividends  or  dividend  equivalents  (whether  paid or  unpaid)  are
participating  securities  and shall be included in the  computation of earnings
per  share  pursuant  to  the  two-class  method.  The  Company's  participating
securities  are  composed of unvested  restricted  stock.  The  adoption of EITF
03-6-1 had no material effect on our computation of EPS.

In November 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued Issue 08-6 (EITF 08-06),
"Equity Method Investment  Accounting  Considerations." This Issue addresses the
impact  that SFAS  141(R) and SFAS 160 might have on the  accounting  for equity
method investments  including how the initial carrying value of an equity method
investment should be determined,  how it should be tested for impairment and how
changes in  classification  from equity method to cost method should be treated.
The Issue is to be implemented  prospectively  and is effective for fiscal years
beginning  after  December 15,  2008.  The adoption of EITF 08-06 did not have a
significant   impact  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations  or  financial
positions.

In December 2008,  FASB issued FSP Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
("SFAS") 140-4 and FASB Interpretation ("FIN") 46 (R)-8,  "Disclosures by Public
Entities  (Enterprises)  about  Transfers of Financial  Assets and  Interests in
Variable  Interest  Entities" ("FSP SFAS 140-4 and FIN 46 (R)").  FSP SFAS 140-4
and FIN 46 (R) amends FASB SFAS 140  "Accounting  for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," to require public entities
to provide  additional  disclosures about transfers of financial assets. It also
amends FASB SFAS 46 (revised December 2003), "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,"  to  require  public  enterprises,  including  sponsors  that  have a

================================================================================

<PAGE>


variable  interest  in  a  variable  interest  entity,  to  provide   additional
disclosures   about  their   involvement   with  variable   interest   entities.
Additionally,  this FSP requires certain  disclosures to be provided by a public
enterprise that is (a) a sponsor of a qualifying  special purpose entity ("SPE")
that holds a variable  interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor
(nontransferor)  of financial assets to the qualifying SPE and (b) a servicer of
a qualifying  SPE that holds a significant  variable  interest in the qualifying
SPE but was  not the  transferor  (nontransferor)  of  financial  assets  to the
qualifying SPE. The  disclosures  required by FSP SFAS 140-4 and FIN 46 (R)" are
intended to provide greater  transparency  to financial  statement users about a
transferor's  continuing  involvement with  transferred  financial assets and an
enterprise's  involvement with variable  interest  entities and qualifying SPEs.
FSP SFAS 140-4 and FIN 46 (R) are  effective for  reporting  periods  (annual or
interim) ending after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently  reviewing the
effect, if any; the proposed guidance will have on its financial statements.

In April  2009,  FASB issued FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1,  "Interim  Disclosures
about  Fair  Value of  Financial  Instruments,"  ("FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1")
which amends SFAS 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial  Instruments,"
to require  disclosures about fair value of financial  instruments in interim as
well as in annual financial  statements.  FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 also amend
APB Opinion 28, "Interim Financial  Reporting,"  to require those disclosures in
all interim  financial  statements.  It is effective for interim  periods ending
after June 15, 2009. The Company is currently  reviewing the effect, if any; the
proposed guidance will have on its financial statements.

In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS 165, "Subsequent Events,"  ("SFAS 165"), which
establishes  general  standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that
occur after the balance sheet date but before financial  statement are issued or
available to be issued. In particular,  SFAS 165 sets forth the period after the
balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate
events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in
the  financial  statements;  the  circumstances  under  which an  entity  should
recognize  events or transactions  occurring after the balance sheet date in its
financial  statements'  and the  disclosures  that an entity  should  make about
events or  transactions  that  occurred  after the  balance  sheet  date.  It is
effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company
is currently  reviewing the effect,  if any; the proposed  guidance will have on
its financial statements.


International Financial Reporting Standards

In November  2008, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued for
comment a proposed  roadmap  regarding  potential  use of  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS")
as issued by the International  Accounting  Standards Board.  Under the proposed
roadmap,  the  Company  would be  required to prepare  financial  statements  in
accordance with IFRS in fiscal year 2014, including comparative information also
prepared under IFRS for fiscal 2013 and 2012. The Company is currently assessing
the potential  impact of IFRS on its financial  statements  and will continue to
follow the proposed roadmap for future developments.


NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN


The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,  which
contemplates  continuation  of the  Company  as a going  concern.  However,  the
Company has an  accumulated  deficit at May 31, 2009 of  $(459,056)  and limited
available  capital.  These matters raise  substantial  doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. In view of these matters, realization of
certain of the assets in the  accompanying  balance sheet is dependent  upon the
Company's ability to meet its financing requirements,  raise additional capital,
and the  success of its future  operations.  There is no  assurance  that future
capital raising plans will be successful in obtaining sufficient funds to assure
the eventual  profitability  of the Company.  Management  believes  that actions
planned  and  presently  being  taken to  revise  the  Company's  operating  and
financial  requirements provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a
going  concern.  The financial  statements do not include any  adjustments  that
might result from these uncertainties.

NOTE 4 - ACCRUED LIABILITIES

Accrued liabilities by major classification are as follows:

NOTE 5 - COMMON STOCK

The Company's  authorized common stock consists of 225 million shares with a par
value of $0.001 per share.

On December 30, 2008,  our Board of Directors  authorized a 30-for-1 stock split
of our $0.001 par value common stock.  This forward stock split became effective
February 17, 2009. As a result of the split,  131,400,000 shares were issued and
outstanding.   The  Company's  common  stock  and  APIC  were  adjusted  with  a
corresponding  charge of $24,187 to retained earnings.  The financial statements
contained   herein  reflect  the  appropriate   values  for  capital  stock  and
accumulated deficit.

All references in the accompanying  financial statements to the number of common
shares and per share  amounts  have been  retroactively  restated to reflect the
forward stock split.

On February 10, 2009, our Articles of  Incorporation  were amended to change the
aggregate  number of shares which we have  authority to issue 225 million shares
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.

On February 10, 2009, our Board of Directors  authorized the  cancellation of 48
million post forward-split  common shares. These restricted shares were owned by
Mr. Dennis Cox and were  cancelled  for no  consideration  at his request.  This
became effective February 24, 2009.


On February 23, 2009, three new directors were appointed  (David Siebenga,  Erik
Odeen and Ira  Steiner).  On  February  26,  2009,  Irene  Getty and  Dennis Cox
resigned  from  the  board of  directors.  Prior to  resigning,  they  suggested
allocating 40 million shares of their  restricted  stock for private sale to the
new five  directors  ("New  Directors") - pending the new Board's  approval.

On March 6, 2009,  our board of  directors  ratified an action made by the prior
directors to sell 40 million of their restricted  shares to the new directors in
a private  transaction.  This was done on condition that the new directors would
accept  positions on the Board in order to develop a working  business  plan for
the  Company.   The  restricted  shares  are   non-transferable   without  being
unanimously  approved by the Board. Under guidelines  provided by SFAS No. 141R,
"Business Combinations",  the New Directors, who received 48% of the then issued
and  outstanding  stock,  were  considered  to be the  largest  minority  voting
interest owner (group of organized  owners)  without the existence of any single
majority owner (or organized  group of owners).  These New Directors  controlled
the Board.

We believe that a "business" as defined under ASC 805-10-65-1 (formerly
SFAS  No.  141R)  was  introduced  by  these  five  New  Directors.  Under  this
definition,  a "business"  may be an integrated  set of activities and assets in
the development  stage,  which might not have outputs.  If no outputs,  then one
must consider if the integrated set:

1. Has begun planned principal activities;
2. Has  employees,  intellectual  property,  and other inputs and processes that
could be  applied to those  inputs;
3. Is  pursuing a plan to produce  outputs; and/or
4. Will be able to obtain  access to customers  that will  purchase the outputs.

The New Directors  brought a business plan  reflecting a viable  business in the
renewable  alternative  energy industry,  which meets a large and timely demand.
These directors possess the industry knowledge and relative experience necessary
to accomplish  their plan. Each of the directors has unique skills and strategic
relationships  which are directly in line with the objectives of this plan. As a
result of these factors,  a change of control was  recognized,  which  triggered
recapitalization  accounting. The shares issued to the New Directors were valued
at the carry-over basis value of the Company's net assets and liabilities. Since
there were no assets or outstanding  liabilities  contributed at the time of the
change of control,  the shares were valued at par. The assets and liabilities of
the  Company  prior to the  change  in  control  continued  to be  reflected  at
historical cost which approximated fair values.


During April and May 2009, subscription agreements were sold to seven accredited
investors  totaling  454,311  shares of common  stock for $0.30,  each,  raising
$136,293.

<PAGE>


Subsequent  to May 31,  2009,  subscription  agreements  were  sold to three (3)
additional  investors  totaling  75,000 shares for $22,500.  $15,000 of this was
received and deposited on May 29, 2009 and  reflected as a short-term  liability
since a subscription agreement was not signed until subsequent to quarter-end.

At May 31, 2009, there were 83,854,311 common shares issued and outstanding.  As
of July 15, 2009, there are 83,929,311 common shares issued and outstanding.

NOTE 6 - COMMON STOCK WARRANTS

On April 25,  2009,  the board of  directors  approved  the issuance of four (4)
million  warrants to a  consulting  group in exchange  for  consulting  services
provided to the Company during the development  stage. These warrants were fully
vested upon  issuance,  have an exercise  price of $0.30,  and have a three-year
term which expires April 24, 2012.

The  common  stock  purchase  warrants  were  not  issued  with  the  intent  of
effectively hedging any future cash flow, fair value of any asset,  liability or
any net investment in a foreign operation. The warrants do not qualify for hedge
accounting.  These  common  stock  purchase  warrants  do not trade in an active
securities market, and as such, we estimated the fair value of these warrants to
be $89,177,  using the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing model using the following
assumptions:

                                                             April 25,
                                                               2009
                                                        --------------------
         Annual dividend yield                                         -
         Expected life (years)                                         3
         Risk-free interest rate                                    1.32%
         Expected volatility                                         110%

Since there has not been any  significant  trading of this stock,  we determined
the  expected  volatility  based on  price  fluctuations  for  development-stage
companies  in similar  alternative  energy  industries,  based on a three-  year
observation, the expected life of the warrants.

Expected  volatility  is based  primarily on historical  volatility.  Historical
volatility  was computed using weekly  pricing  observations  for recent periods
that  correspond  to the last 36 months.  We believe  this  method  produces  an
estimate that is  representative  of our expectations of future  volatility over
the expected  term of these  warrants.  We  currently  have no reason to believe
future  volatility over the expected  remaining life of these warrants is likely
to differ materially from historical  volatility.  The expected life is based on
the  remaining  term of the warrants.  The  risk-free  interest rate is based on
three-year U.S. Treasury securities.


NOTE 7 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Professional Services Agreement

The Company is in the process of formalizing an agreement with a consulting firm
for services related to debt and equity capital raising and business development
activities.  Consulting fees for the quarter ended May 31, 2009 totaling $75,000
have been  approved by  management  and accrued for. A fee schedule for debt and
equity  raising has not been  finalized  yet, but will consist of cash and stock
compensation.


NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES

The Company is subject to US federal income taxes. The Company has had losses to
date, and therefore has paid no income taxes.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary timing differences in the recognition
of income and expenses for financial  reporting and tax purposes.  The Company's
deferred  tax assets  consist  entirely of the benefit from net  operating  loss
(NOL)  carry-forwards.  Effective March 1, 2009,  prior net operating loss carry
forwards  are  no  longer  available  to  the  Company,  due  to  the  Company's
abandonment of the related travel  services  business.  Any future net operating
losses, based on operations of the renewable energy business, will be considered
for NOL carry-forward.

During the  quarter,  federal  income tax returns for the prior three years were
prepared and filed. Late fees and penalties were immaterial.

NOTE 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On June 3, 2009, Sea 2 Sky entered into a comprehensive  joint venture agreement
with  Gateway  Associates  LLC, a company  controlled  by Mr. Henry James of the
Lummi Nation. This agreement brings together distinctive market access rights to
manufacture and distribute wood pellets to institutional and industrial  markets
for Sea 2 Sky in a manner that has never been  achieved to date. As part of this
agreement,  Gateway's  network will facilitate  access to the  institutional and
industrial  markets based on its and other  Special Category  Businesses  Rights
designations   and  its  status  in  the  Foreign   Trade  Zones  Act  of  1934.
Institutional  access to markets includes  cumulative mandates set by the United

<PAGE>

States of America Federal Government  guidelines that amount to 23% of the total
US Federal budget.  Industrial market access often requires similar  percentages
as the institutional market guidelines to be eligible for continued  contracting
with  the US  Government.  Both Sea 2 Sky and  Gateway  have  determined  that a
substantial  opportunity  exists  in the  wood  pellet  market  and are  jointly
co-operating  to  satisfy  the unmet  market  demand.  Based on  current  market
evaluations, up to 17 percent of the US Federal procurement budget ($425 Billion
approx.)  is yet open to be met by Special  Category  Business  businesses  like
those  contained in Gateway's  network.  The  industrial  market of unmet market
demand is of similar size.

The wood pellet market is considerable in size  internationally  with Europe and
Asia having substantial  multi-Billion  dollar product  requirements.  The North
American  market demand is vast and growing daily with  increased  pressure from
industry and governments to reduce energy waste and carbon emissions. One method
that is increasingly  being evaluated and implemented is the use of wood pellets
both commercially and residentially to heat/cool and provide energy requirements
in a carbon-neutral  manner.  In  addition  the  use of  Carbon  Credits  is now
international in scope and provides many opportunities to the Industry to become
socially  responsible  and  reduce  their  "Carbon  Footprint".  With the  Kyoto
Protocol  framework  in place and the United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on
Climate Change  (UNFCCC)  mandates and  administration  in effect,  Sea 2 Sky is
committed to bringing ethical  standards and production  methods to this growing
market.

On June 23, 2009,  Sea 2 Sky entered into an Assignment  Agreement  (Assignment)
with James Forest  Products LLC (JFP).  JFP is a Limited  Liability  Corporation
organized in accordance  with the laws of the Lummi Nation,  located  within the
United  States of  America  and is owned and  controlled  by Henry V.  James,  a
registered Lummi Nation tribal member.  Mr. James is a director of Sea 2 Sky and
serves as the Chairman of the Board of Sea 2 Sky.

As part  of the  Assignment,  JFP  has  granted  and  assigned  to Sea 2 Sky its
interest in a fiber basket owned by JFP for consideration of one dollar ($1.00).
The fiber basket consists of a defined volume of available wood  materials.  JFP
has access to such fiber basket through the Memorandum of Understanding  ("MOU")
it has entered into with Des Wilson  Forestry  Ltd.,  of New Zealand on June 23,
2009. The final legal  arrangement  between JFP and Des Wilson  Forestry Ltd. is
dependent upon the completion of due diligence by both parties.

The MOU provides for an allowable  annual cut or availability of biomass through
sawmill  residue  such as sawdust,  shavings,  hog fuel,  wood chips,  Pulp Logs
and/or  residuals from logging  operations) of an initial  250,000 tons per year
and  provides  that it can be  increased  to  500,000  tons  within  2 years  of
commencing the project.

Tenure of  ownership  is a long  term  lease,  license,  outright  ownership  or
hereditary rights of ownership of at least 15 years.

On June 26, 2009,  the Company  established  a select global  advisory  board to
assist the company in meeting its increasing supply and demand  opportunity that
exists in the Company's marketplace.  Sea 2 Sky is pleased to announce the first
appointment of Mr. Richard Walton,  BSc, P. Eng., a former technical director of
manufacturing and project manager of a major European  Regeneration  facility to
its Advisory Board. Mr. Walton's breadth of experience and knowledge of evolving
building codes with increasing  emphasis to use renewable  biomass in the United
Kingdom along with his contact  network within Europe greatly  assists Sea 2 Sky
in meeting and  opening up the market in Europe.  Several  market  opportunities
exist for Sea 2 Sky  throughout  Europe and the  Company  plans to  aggressively
market with Mr. Walton and its recently announced supply contract [memorandum of
understanding]  in New Zealand."

The  European  Union (EU) and other  countries  now  legally  mandate the use of
biomass  sources of energy for domestic and  Industrial  use. In some regions of
Austria,  80% of new Homes  already  use  biomass  for  heating,  and the United
Kingdom  building code for sustainable  housing  currently  mandates 100% of new

homes by 2012 to use  renewable  technologies.  Wood pellet  biomass is the most
accepted and most feasible source of this Energy. Demand for wood pellet biomass
in Europe is  forecasted  to increase up to 10 fold from the current 7.5 million
tons,  annually,  to as much as 75 million tons by 2020  representing  a current
dollar market increase from $1,725,000,000 to $17,250,000,000.

See NOTE 5 for additional common stock issued for cash in June 2009.



NOTE 10 - RESTATEMENT OF FORM 10-Q

On  December  7, 2009,  the  Company  amended  this  report on Form  10-Q/A (the
"Amendment")to  our  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31,
2009,  which was filed with the Securities  and Exchange  Commission on July 15,
2009. This Amendment is being filed for the purpose of correcting the accounting
treatment  used to record  common stock shares  issued to five (5) new Directors
(the "New Directors") during March 2009.

This Report has been amended to reverse $2,360,000 of previously  recorded stock
compensation  expense in excess of par value  ($0.001 per share) for  40,000,000
shares of SSKY common  stock issued to the New  Directors  as an  incentive  for
joining the Company with their new business plan in  alternative  energy.  Under
guidelines  provided  by FASB  issued  ASC  805-10-65-1  (formerly  SFAS No. 141
(revised 2007),  "Business  Combinations"  ("SFAS 141R") which replaces SFAS No.
141, "Business Combination"), these New Directors were determined, subsequent to
the initial filing of this Form 10-Q, to have effected a change in control since
the New Directors owned  approximately 47% of the outstanding  shares,  and they
controlled  the Board of Directors  and intended  operations.  Accordingly,  the
share transactions should be accounted for as a recapitalization and no goodwill
recorded.  As a result,  stock  issued  to the New  Directors  should  have been
recorded at par value ($0.001 per share) of $40,000, as there was no transfer of
identifiable assets which would have been recorded at their historical costs.

As a result of this restatement,  the following balances were adjusted as of and
for the nine months ended May 31, 2009:

Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with our  unaudited
financial  statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with, and
because we desire to take  advantage  of, the "safe  harbor"  provisions  of the
Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding
certain forward looking statements in the following  discussion and elsewhere in
this report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not
in future filings with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  Forward-looking
statements are statements not based on historical  information  and which relate
to future  operations,  strategies,  financial results,  or other  developments.
Forward-looking  statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions
that are inherently subject to significant business,  economic, and competitive,
uncertainties and  contingencies,  many of which are beyond our control and many
of which,  with  respect to future  business  decisions,  are subject to change.
These  uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause
actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any  forward-looking
statements  made by, or on our behalf.  We  disclaim  any  obligation  to update
forward-looking statements.

The following discussion of the plan of operations, financial condition, results
of  operations,  cash flows and  changes in  financial  position  of our Company
should be read in  conjunction  with our most recent  financial  statements  and
notes  appearing  elsewhere in this Form 10-Q,  in our Form 10-Q filed April 20,
2009 and in our Form 10-K filed on November 25, 2008.

The  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm's report on the Company's
financial  statements  as  of  August  31,  2008,  includes  a  "going  concern"
explanatory  paragraph  that  describes  substantial  doubt about the  Company's
ability to  continue  as a going  concern.  Management's  plans in regard to the
factors prompting the explanatory paragraph are discussed below and also in Note
3 to the unaudited quarterly financial statements.


Original Plan of Operations

Sea 2 Sky has had limited  operations  over the last three  years.  Our business
plan focused on providing a professional and personalized  all-inclusive  travel
package to tourists  visiting  western Canada and  specifically  the Province of
Alberta.  A personal  assistant  would be assigned to each client to ensure that
every aspect of the trip was considered and addressed and to bridge the language
barrier in order to prevent frustration for travelers.

We had planned to establish a travel  agency  affiliate in a major city in Japan
and eventually develop in five major cities overseas while continuing  marketing
efforts through the Internet.  The intent was to create  strategic  partnerships
with travel and special-event  companies in order to grow the customer base. The
desired results were not achieved. As a result, we decided to abandon the travel
business;  assets and expenses related to the travel business were  reclassified
from current operations to that of discontinued  operations for proper financial
presentation.  The total  net loss  from  these  discontinued  operations  since
inception is $18,241.


Change in Management

As a result of continuing limited revenues from travel operations in a difficult
economic   environment,   management  had  to  consider  other  business  growth
opportunities.

The Company has expanded the number of Board members from three (3) to seven (7)
members to broaden the experience  base. In December 2008,  Messrs.  Henry James
and Doug Robertson,  both having  extensive  experience in the forestry  sector,
were appointed to the Company's Board of Directors.

================================================================================
Sea 2 Sky                                                                Page 19

<PAGE>

Messrs. James and Robertson have worked in the forestry sector together and have
been  involved  with forestry  issues  between  Canada and the United States and
cross border  shipping of forest  products.  As a Native  American,  Henry James
suggested  the Company begin to  investigate  opportunities  in working  between
indigenous groups in Canada to see if opportunities  existed for forest products
trading in United States, Canada or abroad.

Due to  their  legal,  accounting  and  international  business  experience,  on
February 23, 2009, Messrs. David Siebenga,  and Erik Odeen were appointed to the
Board of Directors to continue  investigations  of trading wood supplies between
United  States,  Canada and abroad.  David  Siebenga was appointed the Company's
Chief  Executive  Officer on February  26,  2009,  and is an  attorney  from the
Province  of British  Columbia,  who over the 20 plus years of his  career,  has
dealt with companies in different international contexts.

The  Board  accepted  the  resignation  of Irene  Getty  who had  served as the
Company's Chief Executive Officer since its inception in November 2005.

Erik Odeen,  who was  appointed the  Company's  new Chief  Financial  Officer on
February 26, 2009, is a Certified  Public  Accountant in the State of California
and a Certified Fraud Examiner,  with over 20 years  experience in manufacturing
operations,  financial management, and public accounting. The Board accepted the
resignation  of Dennis  Cox who had  served  as the  Company's  Chief  Financial
Officer since July 2008.

Also on  February  23,  2009,  Mr. Ira  Steiner  was  appointed  to the Board of
Directors to provide the Company with contacts in the European  marketplace.  An
Austrian native with long-term wood sales experience,  Mr. Steiner's role within
the Company is to source  markets and contacts to sell  biomass and  alternative
fuels in Europe and other countries.


Change of Operational Focus

The  Company is  exploring  an emerging  opportunity  in the  alternative  fuel,
biomass  sector of the  forest  industry.  As a result  of the  native to native
contacts,  the  Canadian  First  Nations  people  have shown  great  interest in
developing  a working  relationship  with the  Company  by  providing  long term
biomass (wood supply) contracts,  provided that those First Nations could obtain
jobs in their local community.


New Plan of Operations

In order to fully evaluate the emerging opportunity, we intend to proceed in two
stages.  The  first  stage  is  to  establish  ourselves  in  the  supply  chain
marketplace by meeting and finalizing various  memorandums of understanding with
First Nations peoples who wish to deal with us. Concurrently,  we will meet with
various Pellet Plant  manufacturers  to determine the best fit for the Company's
needs for plants as well as continue to pursue markets for the pellets produced.
Once this preliminary evaluation is done, we anticipate placing a deposit on our
first plant.  Thereafter,  upon  production  and having the ability to go to the
market with its Pellet product,  we anticipate creating further plants as demand
increases.  We intend to raise  $1,000,000 to fund its initial  requirement.  We
cannot make any assurances that we will be able to raise such funds.

In anticipation of achieving our funding requirements,  we, as a manufacturer of
wood  pellets,  are  beginning to negotiate  with  various  consumer  groups and
suppliers of wood pellets to market  within Europe and North America in order to
secure contracts to deliver  pellet-able  biomass for their customers.  Once the
supply  and  market  positions  are  secured,  we will  seek  financing  for the
construction  of pellet mills to be placed on the First Nations (or other) sites
within  western  Canada,  thus producing jobs for the local area and pellets for
sale in the  marketplace.  Based on current  research,  we are aware of and have
leads into  approximately 20 different  locations suitable for pellet production
within British Columbia;  Alberta, Canada; three states within the United States
of America; and New Zealand. Based on current market demand and trends, we see a
market opportunity to produce for sale and sell over 1.3 million tons of pellets
per year.

Once the pellet mill has been  constructed,  we plan to market these  pellets to
both North American and international markets.  There is no assurance,  however,
that we will be able to raise such funds and allow us to carry out its business.


Subsequent Events

On June 3, 2009, Sea 2 Sky entered into a comprehensive  joint venture agreement
with  Gateway  Associates  LLC, a Company  controlled  by Mr. Henry James of the
Lummi Nation. This agreement brings together distinctive market access rights to

================================================================================
Sea 2 Sky Corporation                                                    Page 20

<PAGE>

manufacture and distribute Wood Pellets to institutional and industrial  markets
for Sea 2 Sky in a manner that has never been  achieved to date. As part of this
agreement,  Gateway's  network will facilitate  access to the  institutional and
industrial  markets based on its and others Special Category  Businesses  Rights
designations   and  its  status  in  the  Foreign   Trade  Zones  Act  of  1934.
Institutional  access to markets includes  cumulative mandates set by the United
States of America Federal Government  guidelines that amount to 23% of the total
US Federal budget.  Industrial market access often requires similar  percentages
as the Institutional market guidelines to be eligible for continued  contracting
with  the US  Government.  Both Sea 2 Sky and  Gateway  have  determined  that a
substantial  opportunity  exists  in the  wood  pellet  market  and are  jointly
co-operating  to  satisfy  the unmet  market  demand.  Based on  current  market
evaluations, up to 17 percent of the US Federal procurement budget ($425 Billion
approx.)  is yet open to be met by Special  Category  Business  businesses  like
those  contained in Gateway's  network.  The  industrial  market of unmet market
demand is of similar size.

The wood pellet market is considerable in size  internationally  with Europe and
Asia having substantial  multi-Billion  dollar product  requirements.  The North
American  market demand is vast and growing daily with  increased  pressure from
industry and governments to reduce energy waste and carbon emissions. One method
that is increasingly  being evaluated and implemented is the use of wood pellets
both commercially and residentially to heat/cool and provide energy requirements
in a carbon-neutral  manner.  In  addition  the  use of  Carbon  Credits  is now
international in scope and provides many opportunities to the Industry to become
socially  responsible  and  reduce  their  "Carbon  Footprint".  With the  Kyoto
Protocol  framework  in place and the United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on
Climate Change  (UNFCCC)  mandates and  administration  in effect,  Sea 2 Sky is
committed to bringing ethical  standards and production  methods to this growing
market.

On June 23, 2009,  Sea 2 Sky entered into an Assignment  Agreement  (Assignment)
with James Forest  Products LLC (JFP).  JFP is a Limited  Liability  Corporation
organized in accordance  with the laws of the Lummi Nation,  located  within the
United  States of  America  and is owned and  controlled  by Henry V.  James,  a
registered Lummi Nation tribal member.  Mr. James is a director of Sea 2 Sky and
serves as the Chairman of the Board of Sea 2 Sky.

As part  of the  Assignment,  JFP  has  granted  and  assigned  to Sea 2 Sky its
interest in a fiber basket owned by JFP for consideration of one dollar ($1.00).
The fiber basket consists of a defined volume of available wood  materials.  JFP
has access to such fiber basket through the Memorandum of Understanding  ("MOU")
it has entered into with Des Wilson  Forestry  Ltd.,  of New Zealand on June 23,
2009. The final legal  arrangement  between JFP and Des Wilson  Forestry Ltd. is
dependent upon the completion of due diligence by both parties.

The MOU provides for an allowable  annual cut or availability of Biomass through
sawmill  residue  such as sawdust,  shavings,  hog fuel,  wood chips,  Pulp Logs
and/or  residuals from logging  operations) of an initial  250,000 tons per year
and  provides  that it can be  increased  to  500,000  tons  within  2 years  of
commencing the project.

Tenure of  ownership  is a long  term  lease,  license,  outright  ownership  or
hereditary rights of ownership of at least 15 years.

On June 26, 2009,  the Company  established  a select global  advisory  board to
assist the company in meeting its increasing supply and demand  opportunity that
exists in the Company's marketplace.  Sea 2 Sky is pleased to announce the first
appointment of Mr. Richard Walton,  BSc, P. Eng., a former technical director of
manufacturing and project manager of a major European  Regeneration  facility to
its Advisory Board. Mr. Walton's breadth of experience and knowledge of evolving
building codes with increasing  emphasis to use renewable  biomass in the United
Kingdom along with his contact  network within Europe greatly  assists Sea 2 Sky
in meeting and  opening up the market in Europe.  Several  market  opportunities
exist for Sea 2 Sky  throughout  Europe and the  Company  plans to  aggressively
market  with Mr.  Walton  and its  recently  announced  supply  contract  in New
Zealand."

The  European  Union (EU) and other  countries  now  legally  mandate the use of
biomass  sources of energy for domestic and  industrial  use. In some regions of
Austria,  80% of new Homes  already  use  biomass  for  heating,  and the United
Kingdom  building code for sustainable  housing  currently  mandates 100% of new
homes by 2012 to use  renewable  technologies.  Wood pellet  biomass is the most
accepted and most feasible source of this energy. Demand for wood pellet biomass

in Europe is  forecasted  to increase up to 10 fold from the current 7.5 million
tons/  annually,  to as much as 75 million tons by 2020  representing  a current
dollar market increase from $1,725,000,000 to $17,250,000,000.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
are based on our  financial  statements,  which have been prepared in accordance
with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States.  The
preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally  accepted in the United States  requires  management to make estimates
and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. By their nature,  these estimates and judgments are subject to
an inherent degree of uncertainty.

We review our estimates on an on-going  basis,  including those related to sales
allowances,  the  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts,  inventories  and  related
reserves,   long-lived   assets,   income  taxes,   litigation  and  stock-based
compensation.  We base our estimates on our historical experience,  knowledge of
current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering
available  information.  Actual  results  may differ from these  estimates,  and
material effects on our operating results and financial position may result.

We  believe  the  following  critical   accounting  policies  involve  our  more
significant  judgments and estimates  used in the  preparation  of our financial
statements.

Accounting for Employee and Director Stock-Based Compensation

The Company  accounts for stock options issued to employees and directors  under
SFAS  No.  123(R),   "Share-Based  Payment".  Under  SFAS  123(R),   share-based
compensation  cost to  employees  is measured  at the grant  date,  based on the
estimated  fair  value of the  award,  and is  recognized  as  expense  over the
employee's requisite vesting period.

Accounting for Non-Employee Stock-Based Compensation

We measure  compensation expense for its non-employee  stock-based  compensation
under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) Issue No. 96-18,  "Accounting for Equity  Instruments  that are Issued to
Other Than Employees for Acquiring,  or in  Conjunction  with Selling,  Goods or
Services".  The fair value of the option issued or expected to be issued is used
to measure the transaction,  as this is more reliable than the fair value of the
services  received.  The fair value is measured at the value of our common stock
on the date that the commitment for  performance  by the  counterparty  has been
reached  or the  counterparty's  performance  is  complete.  In the  case of the
issuance of stock options,  we determine the fair value using the  Black-Scholes
option  pricing  model.  The fair  value of the  equity  instrument  is  charged
directly to stock-based  compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in
capital.

Equity Events

On December 30, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a 30-for-1 forward stock
split of our $0.001 par value common stock. This share dividend became effective
February  17,  2009.  As a  result  of  the  forward  stock  split,  127,020,000
additional shares were issued.  Capital and additional paid-in capital have been
adjusted accordingly. All references in the accompanying financial statements to
the  number  of common  shares  and per share  amounts  have been  retroactively
restated to reflect the forward stock split.

On February 10, 2009, our Articles of  Incorporation  were amended to change the
aggregate  number  of shares  which we have  authority  to issue to two  hundred
twenty five million  (225,000,000)  shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share.  Also,  on February  10,  2009,  our Board of  Directors  authorized  the
cancellation of 48,000,000 post  forward-split  common shares.  These restricted
shares were owned by Mr. Dennis Cox and were cancelled for no  consideration  at
his request. This became effective February 24, 2009.

================================================================================

<PAGE>


On March 6, 2009,  our board of  directors  ratified an action made by the prior
directors to sell 40 million of their restricted  shares to the New Directors in
a private  transaction.  This was done on condition that the new directors would
accept  positions on the Board in order to develop a working  business  plan for
the company in the wood pellet  industry.  Although an auditable  "business"  as
defined under Regulation S-X was not brought in, we believe that a "business" as
defined under ASC 805-10-65-1(formerly SFAS No. 141)was introduced by these five
New Directors.  Under this definition,  a "business" may be an integrated set of
activities and assets in the development stage, which might not have outputs. If
no outputs, then one must consider if the integrated set:

     1.   Has begun panned pricipal activities;
     2.   Has employees,  intellectual  property, and other inputs and processes
          that could be applied to those inputs;
     3.   Is pursuing a plan to produce outputs; and/or,
     4.   Will be able to obtain  access to  customers  that will  purchase  the
          outputs.

The New  Directors  brough a business plan  reflecting a viable  business in the
renewable  alternative  energy industry,  which meets a large and timely demand.
These directors possess the industry knowledge and relative experience necessary
to accomplish  their plan. Each of the directors has unique skills and strategic
relationships which are directly in line with the objectives of this plan.


The restricted shares are non-transferable without being unanimously approved by
the Board.  Based on the grant date  market  price of $0.066,  less a de minimus
discount of 10%, we recorded stock compensation expense of $2,360,000.

During March and April 2009,  common stock  subscription  agreements for 454,311
shares of common stock for $0.30, each,  raising $136,293.  These funds were for
operating  capital. As of May 31, 2009 there are 83,854,311 common shares issued
and outstanding.

On April 25,  2009,  the board of  directors  approved  the issuance of four (4)
million  warrants to a  consulting  group in exchange  for  consulting  services
provided to the Company during the development  stage. These warrants were fully
vested upon  issuance,  have an exercise  price of $0.30,  and have a three-year
term which expires April 24, 2012.  The market value at grant date was $0.06 per
share.  Using the Black Scholes  options  pricing  model,  we estimated the fair
market value of these  options to be $89,117,  which was booked to  compensation
expense - consultants during the quarter.


Results of Operations

For The Three Months  Ended May 31, 2009  Compared To The Three Months Ended May
31, 2008.

We did not recognize any revenues from operations during the three months ending
May 31, 2009, or during the three months ending May 31, 2008.


For the three  months  ended May 31,  2009,  operating  expenses  were  $338,010
compared to $6,963 during the three months ended May 31, 2008.  The increase was
due primarily to the employment of five new directors and officers, and engaging
a consulting  group to assist with raising  capital as a result of the Company's
new business  focus.  Operating  expenses  during the three months ended May 31,
2009,  consisted  of  $132,342  in wages,  fees and stock  compensation  expense
related  to  our  five  new  directors  hired  in  February  2009;  $169,341  in
professional fees and stock compensation expense realized for initial consulting
services received during our development stage; amortization and depreciation of
$3,275; and office and administration costs of $33,052.  During the three months
ended May 31, 2008, there were no wages or stock compensation expense; operating
expenses  consisted of professional  fees of $5,765,  office and  administration
costs of $444, and depreciation and amortization expense of $754.

During the three months ended May 31, 2009, we recognized a net loss of $338,010
compared to a net loss of $6,963 for the three months  ended May 31,  2008.  The
increase  of  $331,047  is  due to an  increase  in  the  Company's  operational
activities over the prior period as discussed above.


For The Nine Months Ended May 31, 2009 Compared To the Nine Months Ended May 31,
2008

We did not recognize any revenues from operations during the nine-month  periods
ending  May  31,  2009,  and May 31,  2008,  other  than  those  related  to the
discontinued operations (travel related services). We recognized a $180 net loss
from  discontinued  operations  during  the nine  months  ending  May 31,  2009,
compared  to a $19,124  net loss from  discontinued  operations  during the nine
months  ending May 31, 2008.  The absence of operating  revenues was a result of
our efforts  during the nine months  ended May 31, 2009 to modify and change our
business plan, as discussed previously.


During the nine months ended May 31,  2009,  we incurred  operating  expenses of
$357,565  compared to $24,552  during the nine months  ended May 31,  2008.  The
increase of $333,013 is a result of engaging new  personnel and  consultants  to
support our increased operational  activities related the Company's new business
focus. During the nine months ended May 31, 2009, operational expenses consisted
of  $132,338  in wages and stock  compensation  expense  related to our new five
directors  hired in  February  2009;  $169,341  in  professional  fees and stock
compensation  expense realized for initial  consulting  services received during
our development stage; $48,481 in office and administrative expenses; and $7,405
in depreciation  and  amortization  costs.  During the nine months ended May 31,
2008, there were no wages or stock compensation  expenses incurred;  operational
expenses  consisted  of  $21,235  in  professional  fees;  $1,557 in office  and
administrative expenses; and $1,760 in depreciation and amortization costs.

During the nine months ended May 31, 2009, we recognized a net loss of $357,745,
compared to a net loss of $43,676 for the nine month period  ended May 31, 2008.

================================================================================

<PAGE>

The $314,069 increased loss is a result of the factors described above.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the financial
statements for the year ended August 31, 2008 contains an explanatory  paragraph
expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as
a result of recurring  losses,  and  accumulated  deficit since  inception.  The
financial   statements   do  not  include  any   adjustments   relating  to  the
recoverability  and  classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and
classification  of  liabilities  that  would be  necessary  if we are  unable to
continue as a going concern.

At May 31, 2009, we had working capital deficit of $100,576, compared to working
capital  of  $28,382 at August 31,  2008.  At May 31,  2009 and 2008,  our total
assets consisted primarily of cash of $121,943 and $36,465, respectively

At May 31, 2009, our total current  liabilities  consisted primarily of accounts
payable  of  $27,495,  accrued  wages  to  directors  of  $105,161  and  accrued
consulting fees of $75,000.  This was an increase from total current liabilities
of $8,500 at August 31, 2008,  which consisted of accounts payable of $2,000 and
accrued liabilities of $6,500.

Cash on hand is  currently  our only  source  of  liquidity.  We do not have any
lending  arrangements in place with banking or financial  institutions and we do
not anticipate that we will be able to secure these funding  arrangements in the
near future.

We did not recognize any revenues from operations  during the nine months ending
May 31, 2009,  other than those related to the discontinued  operations  (travel
related  services).  Our short and long term survival is dependent on sufficient
revenue resulting in a profitable  operation or funding from sales of securities
as necessary.

We believe our  existing  cash  balances  are  insufficient  to carry our normal
operations over the next three (3) months.  Our short and long-term  survival is
dependent on funding from sales of securities  as necessary or from  shareholder
loans,  and thus, to the extent that we require  additional funds to support our
operations or the expansion of our business,  we may attempt to sell  additional
equity  shares or issue debt.  Any sale of  additional  equity  securities  will
result in dilution  to our  stockholders.  Recent  events in  worldwide  capital
markets may make it more difficult for us to raise additional equity or capital.
There can be no  assurance  that  additional  financing,  if  required,  will be
available to us or on acceptable terms.

In  addition,  the  United  States is  experiencing  severe  instability  in the
commercial  and investment  banking  systems which is likely to continue to have
far-reaching   effects  on  the   economic   activity  in  the  country  for  an
indeterminable period. The long-term impact on the United States economy and the
Company's operating  activities and ability to raise capital cannot be predicted
at this time, but may be substantial.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Sea 2 Sky currently does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.


Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

As a "smaller  reporting  company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation  S-K, the
Company is not required to provide  information  required by this Item. However,
we do not hold any  derivative  instruments  and do not  engage  in any  hedging
activities.


Item 4.      Controls and Procedures

(a)  Evaluation  of  Disclosure  Controls and  Procedures.  Our Chief  Executive
Officer  and  Chief  Financial   Officer  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  our
disclosure  controls and  procedures as of the end of the period covered by this

================================================================================

<PAGE>

report.  Based on that  evaluation,  our Chief  Executive  and  Chief  Financial
Officer  concluded that our disclosure  controls and procedures as of the end of
the period  covered by this  report  were  effective  such that the  information
required to be  disclosed  by us in reports  filed under the Exchange Act is (i)
recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii)  accumulated and communicated to our Chief
Executive  Officer and Chief Financial  Officer,  as appropriate to allow timely
decisions  regarding  disclosure.  A controls  system  cannot  provide  absolute
assurance,  however,  that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no
evaluation of controls can provide  absolute  assurance  that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

Item 4T.  Controls and Procedures

Our Chief  Executive  Officer and Chief  Financial  Officer are  responsible for
establishing and maintaining  adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over
financial  reporting  is a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance
regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of
financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.   Therefore,  even  those  systems
determined  to be effective can provide only  reasonable  assurance of achieving
their  control  objectives.   Furthermore,   smaller  reporting  companies  face
additional limitations. Smaller reporting companies employ fewer individuals and
find it difficult to properly  segregate  duties.  Often, one or two individuals
control  every  aspect  of the  Company's  operation  and are in a  position  to
override  any  system  of  internal  control.  Additionally,  smaller  reporting
companies  tend to utilize  general  accounting  software  packages  that lack a
rigorous set of software controls.

Our  Chief  Executive   Officer  and  Chief  Financial   Officer  evaluated  the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting as of
May 31, 2009. In making this assessment,  our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief
Financial  Officer used the criteria  set forth by the  Committee of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework.  Based on this  evaluation,  Our Chief  Executive  Officer  and Chief
Financial  Officer concluded that, as of May 31, 2009, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial  Reporting.  There were no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f)  under the Exchange  Act,  during our most recently  completed  fiscal
quarter that have materially  affected,  or are reasonably  likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.      Legal Proceedings

We are  currently  not involved in any  litigation  that we believe could have a
material  adverse  effect on our financial  condition or results of  operations.
There is no action, suit, proceeding,  inquiry or investigation before or by any
court,  public board,  government agency,  self-regulatory  organization or body
pending or, to the knowledge of the executive  officers of our company or any of
our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock,
any of our  subsidiaries  or of our companies or our  subsidiaries'  officers or
directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a
material adverse effect.


Item 2.     Unregistered Sales of Equity And Use Of  Proceeds

On December 30, 2008,  our Board of Directors  authorized a 30-for-1 stock split
of our $0.001 par value common stock.  This forward stock split became effective
February 17, 2009. As a result of the split,  131,400,000 shares were issued and
outstanding.   The  Company's  common  stock  and  APIC  were  adjusted  with  a
corresponding charge of $24,187 to retained earnings.

On April 25,  2009,  the board of  directors  approved  the issuance of four (4)
million  warrants to a  consulting  group in exchange  for  consulting  services
provided to the Company. These warrants were fully vested upon issuance, have an
exercise  price of $0.30,  and have a three-year  term which  expires  April 24,
2012.

During April and May 2009, subscription agreements were sold to seven accredited
investors  totaling  454,311  shares of common  stock for $0.30,  each,  raising
$136,293.

Exemption from Registration Claimed

All of the sales by the Company of its unregistered  securities were made by the
Company in reliance  upon Section 4(2) of the Act.  The  affiliate  listed above
that  purchased  the  unregistered  securities  was known to the Company and its
management,  through  pre-existing  business  relationships.  The  purchaser was
provided  access to all  material  information,  which they  requested,  and all
information  necessary to verify such  information  and was  afforded  access to
management of the Company in connection with the purchases. The purchaser of the
unregistered  securities  acquired such securities for investment and not with a
view  toward  distribution,  acknowledging  such  intent  to  the  Company.  All
certificates  or  agreements  representing  such  securities  that  were  issued
contained restrictive legends,  prohibiting further transfer of the certificates
or agreements representing such securities, without such securities either being
first registered or otherwise exempt from  registration in any further resale or
disposition.


Item 3.      Defaults upon Senior Securities

There were no defaults  upon senior  securities  during the period ended May 31,
2009.


Item 4.      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters  submitted for a vote of our security  holders  during the
period ended May 31, 2009.


Item 5.      Other Information

On May 22,  2009,  the Company  dismissed  Schumacher  &  Associates,  Inc.  the
independent accountants previously engaged as the principal accountants to audit
our financial statements. The decision to change accountants was approved by our
Board of Directors.

 Also  effective  on May 22, 2009,  we engaged dbb  mckennon,  Certified  Public
Accountants,  as our independent  certified public accountants.  The decision to
change accountants was approved by our Board of Directors.

These events have been previously  disclosed in Current Report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC.
