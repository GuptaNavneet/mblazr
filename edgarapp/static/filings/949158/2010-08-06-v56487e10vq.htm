<B>Note 1 &#151; Basis of Presentation</B>
<!-- xbrl,body -->
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these notes, Cray Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as
the &#147;Company.&#148; In the opinion of management, the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets
and Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statements of Cash Flows have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(&#147;GAAP&#148;) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule&nbsp;10-01 of
Regulation&nbsp;S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP
for complete financial statements. Management believes that all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. Interim
results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this
Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and the financial statements and notes thereto included in the
Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 (the &#147;2009 Form
10-K&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s revenue, results of operations and cash balances are likely to fluctuate
significantly from quarter-to-quarter. These fluctuations are due to such factors as the high
average sales prices and limited number of sales of the Company&#146;s products, the timing of purchase
orders and product deliveries, the revenue recognition accounting policy of generally not
recognizing product revenue until customer acceptance and other contractual provisions have been
fulfilled and the timing of payments for product sales, maintenance services, government research
and development funding and purchases of inventory. Given the nature of the Company&#146;s business, its
revenue, receivables and other related accounts are likely to be concentrated among a few
customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, the Company incurred a net loss of $18.2&nbsp;million
and used $25.3&nbsp;million of cash in operating activities. The Company had $84.1&nbsp;million of working
capital as of June&nbsp;30, 2010. Management&#146;s plans project that the Company&#146;s current cash resources
and cash to be generated from operations will be adequate to meet the Company&#146;s liquidity needs for
at least the next twelve months. These plans assume sales, shipment, acceptance and subsequent
collections from several large customers, as well as cash receipts on future sales opportunities
not yet contracted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Principles of Consolidation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cray Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Use of Estimates</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on management&#146;s best knowledge of
current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in
accounting for, among other items, fair value or selling price determinations used in revenue
recognition, percentage of completion accounting, estimates of proportional performance on
co-funded engineering contracts and prepaid engineering services, realization of accounts
receivable, valuation of inventory, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, determination
of future cash flows associated with impairment testing for long-lived assets, determination of the
fair value of stock options and assessments of fair value, realization of deferred income tax
assets, potential income tax assessments and other contingencies. The Company bases its estimates
on historical experience, current conditions and on other assumptions that it believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Revenue Recognition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company
considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an
arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped or services
provided to the customer, risk of loss has transferred to the client, and a customer acceptance has
been obtained. The sales price is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material
contingencies related to the sales have been resolved. The Company records revenue in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations net of any sales, use, value added or certain excise
taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions. In addition to the
aforementioned general policy, the following are our statements of policy with regard to
multiple-element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of
revenue.

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Multiple-Element Arrangements. </I>The Company commonly enters into revenue arrangements that
include multiple deliverables of its product and service offerings due to the needs of its
customers. Product may be delivered in phases over time periods which can be as long as five years.
Maintenance services generally begin upon acceptance of the first equipment delivery and future
deliveries of equipment generally have an associated maintenance period. The Company considers the
maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product, which may include a warranty period
and accordingly allocates a portion of the arrangement consideration as a separate deliverable
which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period. Other services such as
training and engineering services can be delivered as a discrete delivery or over the term of the
contract. A multiple-element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if the
following criteria are met:

to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered
probable and substantially in the control of the Company.</div></TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these criteria are not met, the arrangement is accounted for as one unit of accounting
which would result in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term or being deferred
until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is delivered.
If these criteria are met for each element and there is a relative selling price for all units of
accounting in an arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of
accounting based on each unit&#146;s relative estimated selling price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company follows a selling price hierarchy in determining the best estimate of the selling
price of each deliverable. Certain products and services are sold separately in standalone
arrangements for which the Company is sometimes able to determine vendor specific objective
evidence (VSOE). The Company determines VSOE based on normal pricing and discounting practices for
the product or service when sold separately.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in an arrangement with
multiple elements, the Company attempts to establish the selling price of each element based on
third-party evidence (TPE). The Company&#146;s inability to establish VSOE is often due to a relatively
small sample of customer contracts that differ in system size and contract terms which can be due
to infrequently selling each element separately, not pricing products within a narrow range, or
only having a limited sales history, such as in the case of certain advanced and emerging
technologies. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold
separately. Generally, the Company&#146;s offerings contain a significant level of customization and
differentiation from those of competitors such that the comparable pricing of products with similar
functionality cannot be obtained. The Company is also often unable to reliably determine what
similar competitor products&#146; selling prices are on a standalone basis as important details of
competitive bids are not available. Therefore, the Company is typically not able to determine TPE.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, as is the case most
of the time, the Company uses estimated selling price (ESP)&nbsp;in its allocation of arrangement
consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if
the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. The Company determines ESP for a product or
service by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, internal costs, gross
margin objectives, and pricing practices. ESP is often based on data collected from prior sales,
but that may not have the sample size or consistency to establish VSOE.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Product. </I>The Company recognizes revenue from sales of products, other than the Cray CX
systems, upon customer acceptance of the system, when the price is fixed or determinable,
collection is reasonably assured and no significant unfulfilled obligations exist. Revenue from
sales of our Cray CX systems is generally recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss
transfers to the customer and collection is reasonably assured.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Service. </I>Maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with
customers. These contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year, although some
are for multi-year periods, often with prepayments for the term of the contract. The Company
considers the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product, which may include a
warranty period. When service is part of a multiple element arrangement, the Company allocates a
portion of the arrangement consideration to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of
selling price. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract.
Maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are performed.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Project. </I>Revenue from design and build contracts is recognized under the
percentage-of-completion (POC)&nbsp;method. Under the POC method, revenue is recognized based on the
costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. If
circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress
toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made. These revisions may result in increases or
decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such revisions are recorded in income in the period
in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by management. The Company
performs ongoing profitability analyses of its contracts accounted for under the POC method in
order to determine whether the latest estimates of revenue, costs and extent of progress require
updating. If at any time these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable, the
entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records revenue from research and development contracts which include milestones,
and may require the development of a prototype system, using the milestone method if the milestones
are determined to be substantive. A milestone is considered to be substantive if management
believes there is substantive uncertainty that it will be achieved and the milestone consideration
meets all of the following criteria:

Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) No.&nbsp;2009-13, <I>Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements</I>. The guidance in ASU 2009-13
provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable
arrangements. The amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price
of a deliverable, which replaces fair value in the revenue allocation guidance, as the allocation
of revenue will be based on entity-specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace
participant. The amendments in ASU 2009-13 are effective for revenue transactions entered into
during fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010. The Company adopted this guidance
effective January&nbsp;1, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a significant impact on the
Company&#146;s financial results nor would it have had a material impact had the guidance been adopted
on January&nbsp;1, 2009. ASU 2009-13 did not to significantly change the Company&#146;s determination of
units of accounting or arrangement consideration allocation methodology used to recognize revenue.

Software Elements</I>. The guidance in ASU 2009-14 changes the accounting model for revenue
arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements. Tangible products
containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the
tangible product&#146;s essential functionality are excluded from the guidance applicable to software
revenue recognition. The amendments in ASU 2009-14 are effective for revenue transactions entered
into during fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010. The Company adopted this guidance
effective January&nbsp;1, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2009-14 did not have a significant impact on the
Company&#146;s financial results nor would it have had a material impact had the guidance been adopted
on January&nbsp;1, 2009.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2010-17, <I>Revenue Recognition &#151; Milestone Method (Topic
605): Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition</I>. ASU 2010-17 provides guidance on defining a
milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue
recognition for research or development transactions. Consideration that is contingent on
achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the
milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to be substantive by meeting
specific criteria. The amendments in ASU 2010-17 are effective for milestones achieved in fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010. In accordance
with the guidance, the Company elected to early adopt its provisions as of January&nbsp;1, 2010. The
adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial results.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under FASB ASC Topic 820, <I>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</I>, based on the observability
of the inputs used in the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of certain
financial assets and liabilities, the Company is required to provide the following information
according to the fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability
of the information used to determine fair values.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted)&nbsp;in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs
utilize observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or
can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets
or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset
or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset
or liability. The following table presents information about the Company&#146;s financial assets and
liabilities that have been measured at fair value as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and indicates the fair value
hierarchy of the valuation inputs utilized to determine such fair value (in thousands):

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares, excluding unvested restricted stock, outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period, which
includes the additional dilution related to conversion of stock options, unvested restricted stock
and restricted stock units as computed under the treasury stock method and, in 2009, the common
shares issuable upon conversion of the then outstanding 3.0% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2024 (&#147;Notes&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three and six month periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, outstanding stock options, unvested
restricted stock grants and restricted stock units were antidilutive because of net losses and, as
such, their effect has not been included in the calculation of basic or diluted net loss per share.
For the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2009, outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock
of 385,000 shares were included in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the six
months ended June&nbsp;30, 2009, outstanding stock options, unvested restricted stock grants and
restricted stock units and warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes were
antidilutive because of net losses and, as such, their effect has not been included in the
calculation of basic or diluted net loss per share. For the three and six month periods ended June
30, 2010, potential gross common shares of 5.3&nbsp;million were antidilutive and not included in
computing diluted EPS. For the three and six month periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2009, potential gross
common shares of 4.8&nbsp;million and 5.2&nbsp;million, respectively, were antidilutive and not included in
computing diluted EPS.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
grant. The Company does not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future. Volatility
is based on historical data. The expected life of an option is based on the assumption that options
will be exercised, on average, about two years after vesting occurs. The Company recognizes
compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest.
Therefore, management applies an estimated forfeiture rate that is derived from historical employee
termination data and adjusted for expected future employee turnover rates. The estimated forfeiture
rate for stock option grants during the three and six month periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 was 7% and
8% respectively. The estimated forfeiture rate for stock option grants during the three and six
month periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2009 was 8% for each period. If the actual number of forfeitures
differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be
required in future periods. The Company&#146;s stock price volatility, option lives and expected
forfeiture rates involve management&#146;s best estimates at the time of such determination, which
impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes methodology and, ultimately,
the expense that will be recognized over the vesting period or requisite service period of the
option. The Company typically issues stock options with a four-year vesting period (the requisite
service period) and amortizes the fair value of stock options (stock compensation cost) ratably
over the requisite service period. The fair value of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock
units is based on the market price of a share of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant
and is amortized over the vesting period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;) which allows employees to
purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at 95% of fair market value on the fourth business
day after the end of each offering period. The ESPP is deemed non-compensatory and therefore is not
subject to the fair value provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth the gross share-based compensation cost resulting from stock
options and unvested restricted stock grants and restricted stock units (before consideration of
any offsets for research and development co-funding) that was recorded in the Company&#146;s Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009 (in

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of June&nbsp;30, 2010, there was $2.5&nbsp;million of aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding stock
options, including $0.8&nbsp;million of aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable stock options.
Intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value for all &#147;in-the-money&#148; options (i.e.,
the difference between the Company&#146;s closing stock price on the last trading day of its second
quarter of 2010 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of common stock
underlying the stock options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option
holders exercised their options on June&nbsp;30, 2010. During the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30,
2010, stock options covering 7,611 shares of common stock, with a total intrinsic value of $8,000,
were exercised. During the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2009, stock options covering 4,775
shares of common stock, with a total intrinsic value of $7,000, were exercised.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview and Executive Summary</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We design, develop, manufacture, market and service high-performance computing (&#147;HPC&#148;)
systems, commonly known as supercomputers, and provide engineering services related to HPC systems
and solutions. Our supercomputer systems provide capability and sustained performance far beyond
typical server-based computer systems and address challenging scientific, economic, engineering and
national security computing problems.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe we are well-positioned to meet the HPC market&#146;s demanding needs by providing
superior supercomputer systems with performance and cost advantages when sustained performance on
challenging applications and total cost of ownership are taken into account. We differentiate
ourselves from our competitors primarily by concentrating our research and development efforts on
the interconnect, packaging and system software capabilities that enable our systems to provide
efficient and high sustained performance at scale &#151; that is, to continue to increase performance
as our systems grow in size. Purpose-built for the supercomputer market, our higher-end systems
balance highly capable processors, highly scalable system software and very high speed interconnect
and communications capabilities. Our current plans are based on gaining market share in the
high-end supercomputer market segment (which is expected to grow), extending our technology
leadership, maintaining our focus on execution and profitability and expanding our addressable
market through broadening of our engineering services offerings, specifically our Custom
Engineering practices, and selling our new Cray CX and Cray XTm systems.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s revenue, results of operations and cash balances are likely to fluctuate
significantly from quarter-to-quarter. These fluctuations are due to such factors as the high
average sales prices and limited number of sales of the Company&#146;s products, the timing of purchase
orders and product deliveries, the revenue recognition accounting policy of generally not
recognizing product revenue until customer acceptance and other contractual provisions have been
fulfilled, the timing of payments for product sales, maintenance services, government research and
development funding, the impact of the timing of new products on customer orders, and purchases of
inventory during periods of inventory build-up. As a result of these factors, revenue, gross
margin, expenses, and certain balance sheet accounts are expected to vary significantly quarter to
quarter and year to year. Also, given the nature of the Company&#146;s business, its revenue,
receivables and other related accounts are likely to be concentrated among a few customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product revenues for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 were significantly lower
than the prior period primarily due to the anticipated release of the new XT6 in the second quarter
and the new Cray XE6 system (formerly referred to as our &#147;Baker&#148; systems) in the second half of
2010, lowering first half revenue; and the recognition of revenue in the first half of 2009 from
product deliveries at the end of 2008. Several customers have deferred purchases pending the
release of Cray XE6 systems, the successor product to the Cray XT5 and Cray XT6, that are expected
to be delivered and accepted during the second half of 2010, with revenue from these system sales
expected to be highly concentrated in the fourth quarter of 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Summary of First Six Months of 2010 Results</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue decreased $80.1&nbsp;million for the first six months of 2010, from $137.2&nbsp;million to
$57.1&nbsp;million, compared to the first six months of 2009, due to decreased product revenue of $83.2
million, largely from Cray XT systems, partially offset by increased service revenue of $3.1
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net loss for the first six months of 2010 was $18.2&nbsp;million compared to a net loss of $1.5
million for the same period in 2009, due to decreased gross profit of $28.4&nbsp;million partially
offset by a $9.5&nbsp;million decrease in operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in net research and development expenses resulting from lower
outside engineering costs and the completion of milestones under funded research and development
contracts.

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of these trends have resulted in the expansion and acceptance of lower-bandwidth
cluster systems using processors manufactured by Intel, AMD and others combined with commercially
available commodity networking and other components, particularly in the middle and lower portions
of the HPC market. These systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost,
and &#147;price/peak performance&#148; is often the dominant factor in HPC procurements outside of the
high-end supercomputer market segment. Vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in
competitive procurements, even at times in larger procurements where &#147;time to solution&#148; is of
significant importance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the markets for the largest systems, those costing significantly in excess of $1&nbsp;million,
the use of commodity processors and networking components can result in increasing data transfer
bottlenecks as these components do not balance processor power with network communication
capability. With the arrival of increasing processor core counts due to new many-core processors,
these unbalanced systems will typically have even lower productivity, especially in larger systems
running more complex applications. We and other vendors have also begun to augment standard
microprocessors with other processor types, such as field programmable gate arrays and graphics
processing units, in order to increase computational power, further complicating programming
models. In addition, with increasing scale, bandwidth and processor core counts, large computer
systems use progressively higher amounts of power to operate and require special cooling
capabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To position ourselves to meet the market&#146;s demanding needs, we concentrate our research and
development efforts on the interconnect, system software and packaging capabilities that enable our
supercomputers to perform at scale &#151; that is, to continue to increase actual performance as
systems grow ever larger in size. We also have demonstrated expertise in several processor
technologies. Further, we offer unique capabilities in high-speed, high bandwidth system
interconnect design, compiler technology, system software and packaging capabilities. We believe
our experience and capabilities across each of these fronts are becoming ever more important,
especially in larger procurements. We expect to be in a comparatively advantageous position as
larger many-core processors become available and as multiple processing technologies become
integrated into single systems. In addition, we intend to expand our addressable market by
leveraging our technologies and customer base, the Cray brand and industry trends by introducing
complementary products and services to new and existing customers, as demonstrated by our emphasis
on Custom Engineering projects and the introduction of our Cray CX family, Cray XT5m and Cray XT6m
systems.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Key Performance Indicators</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our
business and evaluate our financial and operating performance, including:
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Revenue. </I>Product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any
reporting period and, for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, is
subject to significant variability from period to period. In the short term, we closely review the
status of product shipments, installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash
receipts; longer-term, we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities, fiscal
funding and product development cycles. Revenue growth is the best indicator of whether we are
achieving our objective of increased market share in the markets we address. The introduction of
the Cray XT family and our longer-term product roadmap, including our Intel initiative and our
&#147;Baker&#148; system (now referred to as Cray XE6), are efforts to increase product revenue. We also plan
to increase our engineering services offerings, specifically our Custom Engineering initiative, and
market new products, such as the Cray CX and Cray XT5m and successor systems, to increase revenue.
Maintenance service revenue is more constant in the short term and assists, in part, to offset the
impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue in any particular period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Gross profit. </I>Our total gross profit margin and our product gross profit margin for the first
six months of 2010 were 31% and 31%, respectively, which reflect decreases from the respective 2009
levels of 34% and 32%, respectively. Product gross profit margin for the first six months of 2010
was negatively impacted by a low margin transaction in the first quarter and a $0.5&nbsp;million charge
for estimated excess inventory. Service gross profit margin of 32% for the first half of 2010 was
down from 38% during the same period in 2009. This was primarily due to the increase in personnel
and third-party costs associated with our increased Custom Engineering activities without
sufficient current quarter revenue to maintain the gross margin. Additionally, service revenue was
reduced by $1&nbsp;million due to an increase in the estimated costs to complete a Custom Engineering
contract that required the reversal of revenue that had been recognized in prior periods. Gross
profit in the first six months of 2009 was negatively impacted by a large, low gross profit
contract (on which $36&nbsp;million was recognized in the first quarter of 2009) and a delay in signing
of a contract and related revenue recognition issues relating to an anticipated Custom Engineering
project on which costs were incurred. We continue to focus on maintaining and improving our product
gross profit over the long term, which we believe is best achieved through product differentiation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Operating expenses. </I>Our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount, the level of
recognized co-funding for research and development and contracted third-party research and
development services. As part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses, we monitor
headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas. Operating expenses for the first six
months of 2010 were approximately $9.5&nbsp;million less than the first six months of 2009 resulting
from a reduction in net research and development expenses due to the achievement of milestones
under funded research and development contracts. Operating expenses can increase significantly in
profitable quarters where incentive compensation can be high.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Liquidity and cash flows. </I>Due to the variability in product revenue and new contracts, our
cash position also varies from quarter-to-quarter and within a quarter. We closely monitor our
expected cash levels, particularly in light of increased inventory purchases for large system
installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and, longer-term, in
product development. Sustained profitability over annual periods is our primary objective, which
should improve our cash position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discussion, as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form
10-Q, are based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingencies. In preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important. These include revenue
recognition, inventory valuation, accounting for income taxes, research and development expenses
and share-based compensation. Our significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 2 to the
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2009 Form 10-K and should be reviewed
in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto
as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial
condition in this interim period. In some cases, these policies represent required accounting. In
other cases, they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require
substantial judgment or estimation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant, including those
relating to the fair value and selling price

determination used in revenue recognition, percentage
of completion accounting, estimates of proportional performance on co-funded engineering contracts
and prepaid engineering services, realization of accounts receivable, determination of inventory at
the lower of cost or market, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, determination of
future cash flows associated with impairment testing of long-lived assets, determination of the
fair value of stock options and other assessments of fair value, realization of deferred income tax
assets, including our ability to utilize such assets, potential income tax assessments and other
contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
materially from these estimates and assumptions.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect
of judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company
considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an
arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped or services
provided to the customer, risk of loss has transferred to the client, and a customer acceptance has
been obtained. The sales price is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all
contingencies related to the sales have been resolved. The Company records revenue in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations net of any sales, use, value added or certain excise taxes
imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions. In addition to the
aforementioned general policy, the following are our statements of policy with regard to
multiple-element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of
revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Multiple-Element Arrangements. </I>The Company commonly enters into revenue arrangements that
include multiple deliverables of its product and service offerings due to the needs of its
customers. Product may be delivered in phases over time periods which can be as long as five years.
Maintenance services generally begin upon acceptance of the first equipment delivery and future
deliveries of equipment generally have an associated maintenance period. The Company considers the
maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product, which may include a warranty period
and accordingly allocates a portion of the arrangement consideration as a separate deliverable
which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period. Other services such as
training and engineering services can be delivered as a discrete delivery or over the term of the
contract. A multiple-element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if the
following criteria are met:

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company follows a selling price hierarchy in determining the best estimate of the selling
price of each deliverable. Certain products and services are sold separately in standalone
arrangements for which the Company is sometimes able to determine vendor specific objective
evidence (VSOE). The Company determines VSOE based on normal pricing and discounting practices for
the product or service when sold separately.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in an arrangement with
multiple elements, the Company attempts to establish the selling price of each element based on
third-party evidence (TPE). The Company&#146;s inability to establish VSOE is often due to a relatively
small sample of customer contracts that differ in system size and contract terms which can be due
to infrequently selling each element separately, not pricing products within a narrow range, or
only having a limited sales history, such as in the case of certain advanced and emerging
technologies. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold
separately. Generally, the Company&#146;s offerings contain a significant level of customization and
differentiation from those of competitors such that the comparable pricing of products with similar
functionality cannot be obtained. The Company is also often unable to reliably determine what
similar competitor products&#146; selling prices are on a standalone basis as important details of
competitive bids are not available. Therefore, the Company is typically not able to determine TPE.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, as is the case most
of the time, the Company uses estimated selling price (ESP)&nbsp;in its allocation of arrangement
consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if
the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. The Company determines ESP for a product or
service by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, internal costs, gross
margin objectives, and pricing practices. ESP is often based on data collected from prior sales,
but that may not have the sample size or consistency to establish VSOE.

systems, upon customer acceptance of the system, when the price is fixed or determinable,
collection is reasonably assured and no significant unfulfilled obligations exist. Revenue from
sales of our Cray CX systems is generally recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss
transfers to the customer and collection is reasonably assured.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Service. </I>Maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with
customers. These contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year, although some
are for multi-year periods, often with prepayments for the term of the contract. The Company
considers the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product, which may include a
warranty period. When service is part of a multiple-element arrangement, the Company allocates a
portion of the arrangement consideration to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of
selling price. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract.
Maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue.

percentage-of-completion (POC)&nbsp;method. Under the POC method, revenue is recognized based on the
costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract. If
circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues, costs, or extent of progress
toward completion, revisions to the estimates are made. These revisions may result in increases or
decreases in estimated revenues or costs, and such revisions are recorded in income in the period
in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by management. The Company
performs ongoing profitability analyses of its contracts accounted for under the POC method in
order to determine whether the latest estimates of revenue, costs and extent of progress require
updating. If at any time these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable, the
entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately.

technological usefulness and anticipated future demand for our inventory components. Due to rapid
changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers, we are continually developing
new products. Additionally, during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or
transitions, we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and
future production and service requirements. As a result, it is possible that older inventory items
we have purchased may become obsolete, be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities
required for production or service requirements. When we determine it is not likely we will recover
the cost of inventory items through future sales, we write down the related inventory to our
estimate of its market value.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our
prospective customers receive funding from U.S. or foreign governments, it is difficult to estimate
future sales of our products and the timing of such sales. It also is difficult to determine
whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales. While we
believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and
assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable, our
estimates may prove to be inaccurate. We have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole
to zero, and we may have future sales of previously written-down inventory. We also may have
additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value. Adjustments to these
estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results. During the first half of 2010,
we recorded a charge of $0.5&nbsp;million related to inventory in excess of estimated future demand. The
largest portion of this write-down related to a Cray custom-made component used on the Cray XT
products known as the Cray SeaStar interconnect purchased in 2008 under a last-time buy

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the
deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations. This assessment is based upon
consideration of available positive and negative evidence, which includes, among other things, our
recent results of operations and expected future profitability. We consider our actual historical
results to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to
establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Estimated interest and penalties
are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of June&nbsp;30, 2010, we had approximately $142.2&nbsp;million of net deferred tax assets, against
which we provided a $139.5&nbsp;million valuation allowance, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of
$2.7&nbsp;million. Our net deferred tax assets relate primarily to certain foreign jurisdictions where
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. We continue to provide a
full valuation allowance against net operating losses and other net deferred tax assets arising in
certain jurisdictions, primarily in the United States and Canada, as the realization of such assets
is not considered to be more likely than not.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses include costs incurred in the development and production of
our hardware and software, costs incurred to enhance and support existing product features and
costs related to future product development. Research and development expenses are expensed as
incurred, and may be offset by co-funding from third parties. We may also enter into arrangements
whereby we make advance, non-refundable payments to a vendor to perform certain research and
development services. These payments are deferred and recognized over the vendor&#146;s estimated
performance period. During the third quarter of 2009, we amended a vendor agreement to settle
outstanding performance issues. We had made advance payments of $16.2&nbsp;million to the vendor. The
amendment called for us to receive a refund of $10.0&nbsp;million of amounts previously paid to the
vendor and the right to receive rebates on future purchases. As of June&nbsp;30, 2010, the full balance
of the refund had been received. The rebate right of $6.2&nbsp;million is classified in &#147;Other
non-current assets&#148; in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. No gain or loss was recorded as a
result of this amendment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amounts to be received under co-funding arrangements with the U.S. government are based on
either contractual milestones or costs incurred. These co-funding milestone payments are recognized
in operations as performance is estimated to be completed and are measured as milestone
achievements occur or as costs are incurred. These estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and
are subject to change, including in the near term. If an estimate is changed, net research and
development expense could be impacted significantly.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not record a receivable from the U.S. government prior to completing the requirements
necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement. Funding from the U.S. government is
subject to certain budget restrictions and milestones may be subject to completion risk, and as
such, there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for
which no reimbursement is recorded, as milestones have not been completed or the U.S. government
has not funded an agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either
revenue or a reduction to research and development expense, based on the specific facts and
circumstances of the contractual arrangement, considering total costs expected to be incurred
compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual
arrangement. In the event

that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue, the corresponding research
and development costs are classified as cost of revenue.

provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable
arrangements. The amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price
of a deliverable, which replaces fair value in the revenue allocation guidance, as the allocation
of revenue will be based on entity-specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace
participant. The amendments in ASU 2009-13 are effective for revenue transactions entered into

arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements. Tangible products
containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the

milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue
recognition for research or development transactions. Consideration that is contingent on
achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the
milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to be  substantive by meeting
specific criteria. The amendments in ASU 2010-17 are effective for milestones achieved in fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010. In accordance

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Product revenue for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 was $9.3&nbsp;million and $18.3
million, respectively, primarily from sales of Cray XT5 systems and third-party equipment. Product
revenue for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2009 was $42.1&nbsp;million and $101.6&nbsp;million,
respectively, primarily from sales of and upgrades to Cray XT systems. Product revenue for the
three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 were significantly lower than the prior period primarily
due to the anticipated release of the new Cray XE6 system in the second half of 2010 and the
recognition of revenue in the first half of 2009 from product deliveries at the end of 2008.
Several customers have deferred purchases pending the release of Cray XE6 systems, the successor
product to the Cray XT5 and Cray XT6, that are expected to be delivered and accepted during the
second half of 2010, with revenue from these system sales expected to be concentrated in the fourth
quarter of 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Service Revenue</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service revenue for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 was $19.5&nbsp;million compared to $20.6
million for the same period in 2009. This decrease was caused by delays on certain Custom
Engineering contracts. Service revenue for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 was $38.8&nbsp;million
compared to $35.7&nbsp;million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $3.1&nbsp;million. This increase
was driven principally by revenue from our Custom Engineering initiative offset somewhat by a $0.5
million decrease in maintenance services revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Cost of Product Revenue and Product Gross Profit</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, cost of product revenue decreased $17.7
million and $56.0&nbsp;million, respectively, based on lower product revenues. For the three months
ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, product gross profit margin increased 3&nbsp;percentage points to 50&nbsp;percent,
compared to the same period in 2009 due to a higher proportion of high margin products being sold
on low volume. Product gross margin for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009 is not indicative
of expected full year results. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, product gross profit margin
dropped 1&nbsp;percentage point from the same period in 2009 partially due to a single low margin
transaction in the first quarter and a $0.5&nbsp;million charge in the first quarter for an inventory
write-down.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Cost of Service Revenue and Service Gross Profit</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of service revenue increased $0.9&nbsp;million and service gross profit margin decreased by 8
percentage points to 34% during the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 compared to the same period in
2009. These changes were principally due to the increase in personnel and third-party costs
associated with our increased Custom Engineering activities ahead of revenue. For the six months
ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, cost of service revenue increased $4.3&nbsp;million and service gross profit margin
decreased by 6&nbsp;percentage points to 32% compared
to the same period in 2009. These changes were primarily due to the increase in personnel and
third-party costs associated with our
increased Custom Engineering activities and a revision in
estimated progress toward completion on a contract accounted for under the percentage completion
method during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross research and development expenses in the table above reflect all research and
development expenditures. Research and development expenses include personnel expenses,
depreciation, allocations for certain overhead expenses, software, prototype materials and outside
contracted engineering expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, gross research and development expenses decreased
$5.8&nbsp;million from the same period in 2009, due to $4.3&nbsp;million lower expenditures on outside
services as a process improvement consulting project was completed in 2009 and $1.3&nbsp;million lower
salary and related expenses. The total of reimbursed research and development and amounts included
in cost of revenue increased $0.8&nbsp;million for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 compared to the
same period in 2009, principally due to higher reimbursement on Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency High Productivity Computing Systems (&#147;DARPA&#148;) programs. Per our agreement with DARPA, we
have one remaining milestone planned for review and completion in 2010 for $12.0&nbsp;million. For the
six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, gross research and development expenses decreased $11.6&nbsp;million
from the same period in 2009, due principally to lower outside services from the completion of the
process improvement consulting costs in 2009 and reduced salary and related expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2010, the Company and DARPA amended the Phase III agreement. As with the previous
contract, we expect to receive reimbursement after the achievement of a series of pre-defined
milestones culminating in the delivery of a prototype system in 2012. Consistent with this change,
certain deliverables have been eliminated from the contract, reducing the overall scope and cost of
the project. The remaining amount of the milestones under the contract was reduced by $60&nbsp;million.
As of June&nbsp;30, 2010, we had earned $122&nbsp;million of reimbursement under the DARPA Phase III
agreement. Pursuant to the recently-amended contract, we are required to spend $285&nbsp;million on our
DARPA Phase III project in order to receive the full $190&nbsp;million of co-funding.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company generates cash from operations predominantly from the sale of high performance
computer systems and related services. The Company typically has a small number of significant
contracts that make up the majority of total revenue. The material changes in certain of the
Company&#146;s balance sheet accounts are due to the timing of product deliveries, customer acceptances,
contractually determined billings and cash collections. Working capital requirements, including
inventory purchases and normal capital expenditures, are generally funded with cash from
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2010 the Company was in the middle of a very large production ramp to deliver a
new Cray XE6 supercomputer to several customers. This production ramp has resulted in a
significant increase in inventory to $110.6&nbsp;million compared to $29.0&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
Associated with this increase is a large increase in accounts payable to $64.9&nbsp;million compared to
$18.8&nbsp;million at year-end. Partially offsetting these impacts on our liquidity position has been
an increase in the current portion of deferred revenues to
$75.9&nbsp;million from $42.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009 resulting principally from contractual
rights to bill certain of these customers for part of the contract before full customer acceptance
and related revenue recognition.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that current cash and cash equivalents balances will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12&nbsp;months. However, any projections of
future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. For example; If we are
unable to manufacture, deliver and obtain customer acceptances of our Cray XE6 systems scheduled
for delivery in the second half of 2010, our 2010 revenue and cash will be substantially reduced
and our financial results will be significantly adversely affected. During the second half of 2010
there will likely be a period of time where our liquidity position is significantly lower than at
June&nbsp;30,
2010 levels. We have discussed and been granted extended payment terms with certain key
suppliers to help us mitigate the impact of our new product manufacturing ramp.

need to assess these and potentially other sources of financing. There can be no assurance that

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest Rate Risk</I>: We invest our available cash principally in highly liquid investment-grade
debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the U.S. government and its
agencies. We do not have any derivative instruments in our investment portfolio. We protect and
preserve invested funds by limiting default, market and reinvestment risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Foreign Currency Risk</I>: We sell our products primarily in North America, Asia and Europe. As a
result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency
exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. Our products are generally priced in
U.S. dollars, and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign
markets. While we commonly sell products with payments in U.S. dollars, our product sales contracts
may call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so, or engage with our foreign
subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short-term in nature, we are subject to foreign currency
exchange risks. As of June&nbsp;30, 2010, we were a party to forward exchange contracts that hedged
approximately $31.3&nbsp;million of anticipated cash receipts on specific foreign currency denominated
sales contracts. These forward contracts hedge the risk of foreign exchange rate changes between
the time that the related contract was signed and when the cash receipts are expected to be
received. Our foreign maintenance contracts are typically paid in local currencies and provide a
natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure. To the extent that we wish to repatriate any of
these funds to the United States, however, we are subject to foreign exchange risks. As of June&nbsp;30,
2010, a 10% change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by
approximately $0.6&nbsp;million.

information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our 2009 annual report on Form

given period. </B>Our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations which make estimating
revenue and operating results for any specific period very difficult, particularly as a material
portion of product revenue recognized in any given quarter and year typically depends on a very
limited number of system sales expected for that quarter and year and the product revenue may
depend on the timing of product acceptances by customers and contractual provisions affecting
revenue recognition. Delays in recognizing revenue from a product transaction or transactions due
to development or product delivery delays, not receiving needed components timely or with
anticipated quality and performance, not achieving customer acceptances of installed systems,
contractual provisions or for other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results in any specific quarter, and could shift associated revenue, gross profit and cash receipts
from one quarter into another, including from one year to another in the case of revenue expected
to be realized in the fourth quarter of any year. In addition, because our revenue is often
concentrated in particular quarters rather than evenly spread throughout a year, as it is expected
to be this year, we may not be able to sustain profitability over successive quarters even if we
are profitable for the year.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have experienced net losses in recent periods and last recorded positive annual net income
in 2003. For example, we recorded a net loss of $10.6&nbsp;million in 2007, a net loss of $40.7&nbsp;million

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the numerous factors affecting our revenue and results of operations, we may not
have net income on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We anticipate that our quarterly
results will fluctuate significantly, and include losses. Delays in component availability, product
development, receipt of orders, product acceptances, reductions in outside funding for our research
and development efforts and achieving contractual development milestones have had a substantial
adverse effect on our past results and could continue to have such an effect on our results in 2010
and in future years.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>If we are unable to manufacture, deliver and obtain customer acceptances of our Cray XE6
systems scheduled for delivery in 2010, our 2010 revenue and cash will be substantially reduced and
our financial results will be significantly adversely affected. </B>Our 2010 expected financial results
are dependent upon our Cray XE6 systems (formerly referred to as our &#147;Baker&#148; systems) that we have
just begun shipping to customers as a substantial portion of our 2010 revenue and cash flow are
expected to be derived from these system sales. To obtain revenue and cash from these sales, we
must manufacture the systems to be delivered, deliver them to customers and obtain customer
acceptances of the systems typically based on performance, functionality and reliability testing.
If we are unable to manufacture and deliver the systems early enough in the year to allow for
customer acceptance testing, or if the systems do not perform as required, we may not be able to
obtain customer acceptances in 2010. To accomplish this, we must also successfully manufacture what
for us would be an extremely large number of system cabinets in a relatively short period of time.
Finally, we must complete customer acceptance testing and meet our contractual requirements to
obtain the customer acceptance of the system and realize the revenue and receive payment for the
system. Because of the complexity of our systems, there are often additional updates or development
work that must be completed even after delivery of a system to a customer to meet the system
acceptance requirements, and we expect that such additional work will likely be required to achieve acceptances of these
systems.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If we are unable to complete all of these items in 2010 for Cray XE6 systems scheduled to
be delivered in 2010, our 2010 revenue and cash will be substantially reduced. We have already
incurred expenses and used a significant amount of cash in 2010 to develop and deliver these
systems and must continue to do so regardless of whether customer acceptances are obtained in 2010,
and therefore our overall financial results and our cash will be significantly adversely affected
if we are not able to obtain revenue and cash from these system sales in 2010. We are working to
obtain extended payment terms with certain key suppliers and are considering adding an additional
credit line to help us mitigate the impact of the requirement that we spend considerable cash in
advance of delivery and acceptance of these systems. Should there be significant delays in product
acceptances for the new Cray XE6 systems the Company may need to assess these and potentially other
sources of financing. There can be no assurance that extended supplier credit terms, additional
lines of credit or other financing will be available in amounts or on terms needed or acceptable to
us, if at all.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>If the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (&#147;DARPA&#148;) terminates our DARPA High
Productivity Computing Systems (&#147;HPCS&#148;) program in whole or in part or if we are unable to achieve
and obtain acceptance of key DARPA milestones when or as expected or at all, our desired strategy
would be adversely affected, our net research and development expenditures and capital requirements
would increase significantly and our ability to conduct research and development would decrease.</B>
The DARPA HPCS program calls for the delivery of prototype systems in 2012, and currently provides
for a contribution by DARPA to us of up to $190&nbsp;million assuming we meet certain milestones, $122
million of which we have already earned. In February of 2010, we completed negotiations with DARPA
to change the scope and schedule of this program, including changes to milestones and payments
allocated to individual milestones, and that resulted in a reduction in the total possible
contribution from DARPA over the term of the HPCS program from $250&nbsp;million to $190&nbsp;million. We
have one additional milestone that could be completed in 2010. If the completion of any development
milestone is delayed, our reported net research and development expenses, and our operating
results, would be adversely affected. If we are unable to complete the remaining milestones, or one
or more milestone payments are delayed, reduced and/or eliminated or the program is terminated, our
cash flows and expenses would be adversely impacted and our product development programs would be
put at risk. If we do not achieve and have accepted a milestone in the period we had originally
estimated, we may incur research and development expense without offsetting co-funding, resulting
in increased net research and development expense during the period. We incurred some delays in
payments for program milestones by DARPA in 2007 and 2008; in addition, as a result of our recent
discussions with DARPA on the changes in scope and program schedule, third and fourth quarters of
2009 and full-year 2009 results were adversely impacted by delays in completing development
milestones. The amount of DARPA funds we can recognize as an offset to our periodic research and
development expenses depends on our estimates of the total costs and the time to complete the
program; changes in our estimates may decrease the amount of funding recognized in any period,
which may increase the amount of net research and development expense recognized in that quarter.
By the project&#146;s completion, we must spend at least $285&nbsp;million on the project for us to receive
all of the DARPA $190&nbsp;million reimbursements; failure to do so would result in a lower level of
DARPA contribution and could result in a termination of the funding contract. DARPA&#146;s future
financial commitments are subject to subsequent Congressional and federal inter-agency action, and
our development efforts and the level of reported research and development expenses would be
adversely impacted if DARPA does not receive expected funding, which could result in a delay in
payment for completed milestones, a delay in the timing of milestones or a decision to terminate
all or part of the program before completion.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>If our strategic initiatives targeting markets outside of the high end of the HPC market,
particularly our Custom Engineering initiative, are not successful, our ability to grow our
revenues and achieve and sustain profitability will be adversely affected. </B>Our ability to
materially grow our revenues and achieve and sustain profitability will be adversely affected if we
are unable to generate sufficient revenue from strategic initiatives targeting markets outside of
the high end of the HPC market, particularly if that segment of the market does not grow
significantly. We currently have three such new strategic initiatives: Custom Engineering; selling
our Cray XT6m and successor systems; and selling our Cray CX and successor systems. Our Custom
Engineering initiative has demonstrated the most growth to date, and we believe it represents the
best opportunity for us to diversify our revenue. To grow our revenue from Custom Engineering, we
must continue to win awards for new contracts, timely perform on existing contracts and develop our
capability for business development, notwithstanding that this is a relatively new initiative and
we do not have significant experience targeting the markets relevant to our Custom Engineering
practices. In addition, many of the new Custom Engineering projects will be for the U.S. government
and likely will require us to enter into agreements that are subject to new or additional Federal
Acquisition Regulations, including costing and pricing requirements to which we have not previously
been subject. These regulations are complex and subject to audit to ensure compliance. We may need
to enhance existing financial and costing systems to accommodate these new requirements. Errors
made in interpreting and complying with these regulations could result in significant penalties.
The Cray XT6m and successor systems require successful sales in a lower priced segment of the
supercomputer market. These efforts require monetary investments ahead of revenue, including adding
experienced personnel and initiating new marketing efforts. Although we have not introduced a
product relying primarily on indirect sales in the past, sales of Cray CX systems will depend upon
continuing to build a new global network of independent resellers in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific and having
those resellers successfully sell these new Cray CX systems in the competitive workgroup server
market.

market, we must begin development of products years ahead of our ability to sell such systems. With
procurements for large systems that require that we link together multiple cabinets containing
powerful processors and other components into an integrated system, our Cray XT6, Cray XE6 and
successor systems must also scale to unprecedented levels of performance. During our internal
testing and the customer acceptance processes, we may discover that we cannot achieve acceptable
system stability across these large systems without incurring significant additional delays and

customers primarily serving the U.S. government have represented the largest single market segment
for supercomputer sales worldwide, including our products and services. In 2007, 2008 and 2009 and
the first six months of 2010, approximately 60%, 81%, 72% and 64%, respectively, of our revenue was
derived from such sales. Our plans for 2010 and the foreseeable future contemplate significant
sales to U.S. government agencies. Sales to government agencies, including further sales pursuant
to existing contracts, may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, such as changes in
procurement policies, budgetary considerations including Congressional delays in completing
appropriation bills, the current economic uncertainty and its effect on government budgets,
domestic crises, and international political developments. If agencies and departments of the

will not be successful. </B>The market for HPC systems is very competitive. An increase in competitive
pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in pricing reductions,
reduced gross margins and loss of market share and revenue. Many of our competitors are established
companies well known in the HPC market, including IBM, NEC, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu, Hitachi,
Silicon Graphics International, Bull S.A. and Sun Microsystems. Most of these competitors have
substantially greater research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than
we do. We also compete with systems builders and resellers of systems that are constructed from
commodity components using processors manufactured by Intel, AMD and others. These competitors
include the previously named companies and Dell, with IBM using both third-party processors and its
own proprietary processors, as well as smaller firms that benefit from the low research and
development costs needed to assemble systems from commercially available commodity products. Such
companies, because they can offer high peak performance per dollar, can put pricing pressure on us
in certain competitive procurements. In addition, to the extent that Intel, IBM and other processor
suppliers develop processors with greater capabilities than the processors we currently use from
AMD or design in over time, our Cray XT6, Cray XT6m, Cray XE6 (formerly referred to as &#147;Baker&#148;) and
successor systems may be at a competitive disadvantage to systems utilizing such other processors
until we can design in, integrate and secure competitive processors, if at all. Although our April
2008 collaboration with Intel is intended to help mitigate this risk, Intel processors are not
expected to be delivered in our Cray XT/XE line of supercomputers until 2012 or 2013.

substantial discounts to potential customers. We have in the past and may again be required to
provide substantial discounts to make strategic sales, which may reduce or eliminate any gross

products, and to develop successor systems and enhancements in a timely manner to meet evolving
customer requirements, which may be influenced by competitive offerings. We may not succeed in
these efforts. Even if we succeed, products or technologies developed by others may render our
products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. The development process is lengthy and costly
and requires us to commit a significant amount of resources well in advance of sales. A
breakthrough in technology could make lower bandwidth cluster systems even more attractive to our
