</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This Amendment No.&nbsp;1 on Form 10-Q/A (this &#147;Amendment&#148;) amends the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 of LOUD Technologies Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), which was
originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) on May&nbsp;15, 2008 (the
&#147;Original Quarterly Report&#148;). On November&nbsp;6, 2008, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K
with the SEC indicating that the Company was in the process of re-evaluating the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. This
Amendment amends the disclosure in Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;4T, &#147;Controls and Procedures&#148; of the Original
Quarterly Report to modify our disclosure regarding management&#146;s conclusion of the effectiveness of
the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the
Original Quarterly Report. (The disclosure in the Original Quarterly Report was incorrectly set
forth under the heading Item&nbsp;4 instead of Item&nbsp;4T.)
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Except as set forth above, this Amendment does not modify or update any other disclosures presented
in the Original Quarterly Report. Except as specifically set forth herein, this Amendment does not
reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Quarterly Report or modify or update
those disclosures, including exhibits to the Original Quarterly Report affected by subsequent
events. Accordingly, this Amendment should be read in conjunction with our filings with the SEC
subsequent to the filing of the Original Quarterly Report, including any amendments to those
filings.

15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company&#146;s reports under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#146;s management,
including the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with this Amendment, the
Company&#146;s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted
an updated evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as
of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In connection with that evaluation,
management considered the following matters:

the Company&#146;s management and board of directors determined that appropriate procedures were

was filed with the SEC. In addition, that review raised questions about whether the steps
previously taken to document and test the Company&#146;s internal control over financial

the Company&#146;s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 and June&nbsp;30,
2008. The investigation was conducted with the assistance of outside legal counsel and was
conducted over an approximately ten-week period. The investigative work included, among other
things: reviewing hard copy and electronic files obtained from the Company and other sources; and
conducting interviews with directors, with present and former members of senior management, with
former outside counsel and with a representative of the Company&#146;s independent registered public
accounting firm. In connection with its investigation, the members of the audit committee
periodically met telephonically with the audit committee&#146;s counsel and the Chairman of the audit
committee periodically communicated with the audit committee&#146;s counsel.

corrective filings amending the Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters
ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 and June&nbsp;30, 2008. In particular, management completed its evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2007
and, on March&nbsp;24, 2009, the Company filed Amendment No.&nbsp;3 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 which contained disclosures regarding such evaluation, including
management&#146;s conclusion that the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was not
effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2007. Moreover, the Company has filed this Amendment, and will file
an amendment to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, to disclose
management&#146;s conclusions about the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the periods covered by those reports. As reported in a Current Report
on Form 8-K filed by the Company on January&nbsp;15, 2009, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors has
determined to deregister the Company&#146;s stock under the Exchange Act. Because deregistration of the
Company&#146;s stock under the Exchange Act would result in the termination of the Company&#146;s reporting
obligations under the Exchange Act, the Company will not implement the other recommendations that
resulted from the audit committee investigation unless the Company does not complete the
deregistration process as anticipated.
