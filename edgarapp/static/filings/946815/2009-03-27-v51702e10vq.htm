NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
September&nbsp;30, 2008<BR>
(Unaudited)</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>1. Description of Business</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">LOUD Technologies Inc. (&#147;LOUD&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) was founded in 1988. The Company was incorporated
in Washington under the name Mackie Designs Inc., and subsequently changed its name to LOUD
Technologies Inc. LOUD is one of the world&#146;s largest dedicated professional audio and music
products companies. As the corporate parent for world-recognized brands Alvarez&#174;, Ampeg&#174;, Crate&#174;,
EAW&#174;, Mackie&#174;, Martin Audio&#174;, and TAPCO&#174;, LOUD engineers, markets and distributes a wide range of
professional audio and musical instrument products worldwide.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our product lines include sound reinforcement speakers, analog mixers, guitar and bass amplifiers
and professional loudspeaker systems. These products can be found in professional and project
recording studios, video and broadcast suites, post-production facilities, sound reinforcement
applications including churches and nightclubs, retail locations, and on major musical concert
tours. The Company distributes its products primarily through retail dealers, mail order outlets
and installed sound contractors. The Company has its primary operations in the United States with
operations in the United Kingdom, Canada and China.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On April&nbsp;11, 2007, the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Martin Audio, Ltd.
(&#147;Martin Audio&#148;), a UK-based manufacturer of loudspeakers and related equipment. The purchase
price was $33.6&nbsp;million, plus fees of $2.1&nbsp;million, for a total consideration amount of $35.7
million. Management believes that the acquisition of Martin Audio added another well-known brand
to the Company&#146;s portfolio of brands and provided the Company with additional geographic and
channel diversification.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Basis of Presentation</B>

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by LOUD
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) for interim
financial statements and includes the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These
statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by generally accepted
accounting principles for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements included in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2007. In management&#146;s opinion, all adjustments  necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the interim periods are reflected
herein. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 are not necessarily
indicative of future financial results.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Use of Estimates</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject
to such estimates and assumptions include the allocation of purchase costs to the estimated fair
value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the carrying amount of property and equipment and
intangibles; valuation allowances for receivables, inventories, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities, goodwill impairment and debt classification. Actual results may differ from those
estimates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Liquidity</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is highly leveraged and maintains a senior credit facility that is critical to its
liquidity and ongoing operations. The Financing Agreement (as defined in Note 8 (Financing))
relating to this credit facility requires us to maintain financial ratios such as a fixed charge
coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio. We are also required to meet certain EBITDA
</DIV>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">targets and adhere to certain capital expenditure limits. The Financing Agreement also restricts
our ability to obtain additional financing, pay dividends, or enter into mergers and acquisitions.
From time to time, we have been in breach of certain of the financial covenants in the Financing
Agreement and have received forbearances from the lenders, entered into waiver agreements with
respect to the defaults and amended the Financing Agreement. For example, we were in default on
certain of the financial covenants as of the end of the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. In
connection with Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to the Financing Agreement entered into on November&nbsp;5, 2008, we
received a waiver from the lenders for those defaults and amended various covenants. The specific
defaults and Amendment No.&nbsp;4 are more fully described in Note 8 (Financing) and Note 11 (Subsequent
Events).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with the terms of the Financing Agreement
in future periods. One of our major suppliers of products suspended manufacturing products for us
in the fourth quarter of 2008. The adverse impacts of the global economic downturn on our
operating performance coupled with the disruption in supplies of products previously manufactured
by this supplier is likely to cause us to be out of compliance with certain covenants under the
Financing Agreement by the end of the first quarter of 2009 unless the lenders agree to waive such
noncompliance or to amend the covenants. While these developments raise substantial doubt about
the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company initiated an ongoing
comprehensive supply recovery plan in December, 2008 and has already established two new contract
manufacturing relationships, scheduled a $3.1&nbsp;million investment in tooling, expanded capacity at a
company-owned facility, and recovered production on 36 models which represent 35% of the 102 models
to be recovered.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If we do breach any covenants under our senior secured credit facility, we intend to seek waivers
from the lenders under the Financing Agreement or to negotiate an amendment to the Financing
Agreement covenants. However, there is no assurance that the lenders will grant waivers, agree to
amend the covenants under the Financing Agreement, allow us to continue borrowing under this credit
facility or otherwise agree to restructure our debt. Moreover, it is likely that external sources
of financing necessary to restructure our debt or fund our operations would not be available and
our controlling shareholder has not provided any assurances that it will provide additional
financial support in the future. If we breach the covenants under our Financing Agreement or
otherwise default on our debt, the lenders have a variety of remedies against us, including
accelerating all amounts outstanding under the credit facility so that such amounts become due
immediately and foreclosing on their security interests, which would allow the lenders (or a third
party purchaser in a foreclosure sale) to take possession of all of our assets; any of such steps
could impede our ability to continue as a going concern. If the supply disruption leads to an
event of default under the Financing Agreement that is not cured or waived, and the lenders
accelerate the indebtedness outstanding under the Financing Agreement, it is likely that the
Company would not have sufficient cash flow from operations or access to other sources of financing
necessary to meet its cash requirements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and
do not reflect all adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties discussed
above.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Revenue Recognition</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from sales of products, net of sales discounts, returns and allowances, are recognized
upon shipment under an agreement with a customer when risk of loss has passed to the customer, all
significant contractual obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable and
collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable. Products are generally shipped &#147;FOB
shipping point&#148; with no right of return. We do have some dealers who finance their purchases
through finance companies. We have manufacturer&#146;s repurchase agreements with the finance companies
and defer the revenue and related cost of goods sold of these sales at the time of the sale. We
then recognize the revenue and related cost of goods sold of these sales when the right of return
no longer exists. Sales with contingencies, such as rights of return, rotation rights, conditional
acceptance provisions and price protection, are deferred until the contingencies have been
satisfied or the contingent period has lapsed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for periods of
between one and six years, with the exception of Alvarez Yairi guitars, which have a limited
lifetime warranty. The estimated cost of warranty obligations, sales returns and other allowances
are recognized at the time of revenue recognition based on contract terms and prior claims
experience.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Foreign Currency</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The financial statements of Martin Audio and UK subsidiaries have been translated into U.S.
Dollars. The functional currency of these subsidiaries is the British Pound. During 2008 the
Company determined that the functional currency of its UK subsidiary should be its local currency
due principally to integration of the operations of these subsidiaries with Martin Audio. All
assets and liabilities in the balance sheet of each subsidiary are translated at period-end
exchange rates. Net sales, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange
prevailing during the period. Translation gains and losses are accumulated in a separate component
of shareholder&#146;s equity. Prior to 2008, the UK subsidiary&#146;s functional currency was the U.S.
Dollar. Assets and liabilities were recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S.
Dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, while net sales, costs and expense and cash
flows were translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses were included in other income (expense).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The functional currency of the Company&#146;s other international subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar.
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. Dollars at the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Net sales, costs and expense and cash flows are
translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Foreign currency transaction
gains and losses are included in other income (expense).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Income Taxes</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding
the ultimate realization of such assets. Management evaluates, on a periodic basis, the
recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the amount of the valuation allowance. At such time
as it is determined that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are realizable, the
valuation allowance would be reduced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability related to goodwill associated with certain
acquisitions which is being amortized for tax purposes, but not for book purposes. As goodwill has
an indeterminable life, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount, if any, of deferred tax
liabilities related to goodwill which will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward
period. Accordingly, the Company increases the valuation allowance with a corresponding deferred
tax provision as the deferred tax liability related to goodwill increases due to continued
amortization of goodwill for tax purposes. The goodwill recorded for Martin Audio, which was
impaired during the third quarter of 2008 (See Note 7), is not deductible goodwill for tax
purposes. As such, the impairment does not affect the calculation of income tax expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has also recorded a deferred tax liability for the intangible assets associated with
the acquisition of Martin Audio. No tax basis was created in the accounting for the intangibles of
this acquisition, creating a deferred tax liability which decreases over time as book amortization
is recognized. The deferred tax liability is in a foreign jurisdiction in which the Company is in
a net liability position, and therefore, the Company does not offset the liability against deferred
tax assets in the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted the provision of Financial Standards Accounting Board
(&#147;FASB&#148;) Interpretation No.&nbsp;48 &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#151; An Interpretation of
FASB 109&#148; (&#147;FIN 48&#148;). As of each of September&nbsp;30, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company had $1.5
million of unrecognized tax benefits. In accordance with FIN 48, the Company elected to recognize
accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense. As of each of September&nbsp;30, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company had approximately
$0.4&nbsp;million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. To the extent
interest and penalties are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued
will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax position. The Company does
not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next
twelve months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows (in thousands):

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We sell products on a worldwide basis and a significant portion of our accounts receivable are due
from customers outside of the United States. Where we are exposed to material credit risk, at
times we require letters of credit or advance payments. No customers from any individual country
outside of the United States accounted for more than 10% of net sales from continuing operations in
any of the periods presented. Sales to United States customers are generally on open credit terms.
In the United States, we primarily sell our products through certain resellers and experience
individually significant annual sales volumes with major resellers. For the three-month periods
ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, the Company had sales to one customer of $4.6&nbsp;million and $7.4
million, or 9.9% and 13.9%, respectively of consolidated net sales. For the nine-month periods
ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, the Company had sales to the same customer of $20.0&nbsp;million and
$25.7&nbsp;million, or 12.9% and 16.6%, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Substantially all of our products are manufactured exclusively by contract manufacturers on our
behalf. Two contract manufacturers produced products that accounted for greater than 10% of the
Company&#146;s net sales for the three and nine month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007. For
the three month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, net sales of products manufactured by
one manufacturer were $18.1&nbsp;million and $14.8&nbsp;million, or 38.6% and 27.9% of net sales,
respectively, while net sales of products manufactured by another manufacturer were $11.4&nbsp;million
and $6.6&nbsp;million, or 24.3% and 12.4% of consolidated net sales, respectively. For the nine-month
periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, net sales of products manufactured by one manufacturer
were $69.1&nbsp;million and $57.6&nbsp;million, or 44.3% or 37.2% of net sales, respectively, while net sales
of products manufactured by another manufacturer were $31.2&nbsp;million and $19.1&nbsp;million, or 20.0% and
12.4% of consolidated net sales, respectively. For more information, see Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A &#147;Risk

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 159&#148;), which provides companies with an option to report selected
financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The objective of SFAS 159 is to reduce both the
complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The Company adopted Statement No.&nbsp;159,
effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, and did not elect the fair value option to measure certain financial
instruments; consequently, Statement No.&nbsp;159 has not had a material impact on the Company&#146;s
financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;162, &#147;The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles&#148; (&#147;SFAS 162&#148;). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the
framework for selecting principles to be used in the preparation and presentation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This statement will be
effective 60&nbsp;days after the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) approves the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board&#146;s amendments to AU Section&nbsp;411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in
Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company does not expect the adoption
of SFAS 162 to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;161, &#147;Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 161&#148;). SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.&nbsp;133,
&#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 133&#148;). It requires
qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures
about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after Nov. 15, 2008. The Company does not
expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141R, &#147;Business Combinations&#148; (&#147;SFAS 141R&#148;), which
establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its
financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non
controlling interest in an acquiree, including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired
in a business combination. The requirements of SFAS 141R are effective for periods beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2008. The Company is still assessing the full impact of this standard on its future
Consolidated Financial Statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Basic and diluted net loss per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per common share would be computed
on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares plus dilutive potential common shares
outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are calculated under the treasury stock method.
Securities that could potentially dilute income per share consist of outstanding stock options and
convertible debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As the Company had a net loss in each of the periods presented, basic and diluted net loss per
common share are the same. Stock options to purchase 357,181 and 376,000 shares in 2008 and 2007,
respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted per share amounts because they are
anti-dilutive. The option strike prices were all greater than the stock price for both the three-
and nine- month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007. In addition, shares issuable upon
conversion of convertible debt have been excluded from the
calculation of diluted loss per
share because they are anti-dilutive.

of our LOUD UK operations and a shift of our domestic manufacturing to overseas contract
manufacturers. During the nine-month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 we incurred approximately
$382,000 of restructuring costs primarily representing employee severance and related costs for 13

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142, the Company applies a fair value based impairment test to the net
book value of goodwill on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an
impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The analysis of potential impairment
of goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step is the estimation of fair value. If step
one indicates that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the
amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of goodwill is less
than its carrying value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Based on numerous factors which arose in the current quarter, including but not limited to
deteriorating economic conditions and related challenges in the markets and industry in which we
compete, the Company&#146;s recent performance relative to historical operating results, projected
future operating results, and troubles with a major supplier, we performed goodwill impairment
testing for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the purpose of this analysis, our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the
income approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future
discounted cash flows, and the market approach. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not
completed this analysis due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of
the goodwill of each reporting unit. However, based on the work performed to date, we have
concluded that an impairment loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, we
have recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $15.5&nbsp;million, representing
our best estimate of the impairment loss during the third quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We expect to finalize our goodwill impairment analysis during preparation of financial statements
for the fourth quarter of 2008. There could be adjustments to the goodwill impairment charge when
the goodwill impairment test is completed. Any adjustments to the Company&#146;s preliminary estimates
as a result of completing this evaluation will be recorded in our financial statements for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.

agreement dated March&nbsp;30, 2007, as previously amended, by and among Martin Holding Limited
(formerly known as Grace Acquisitionco Limited), certain subsidiaries of LOUD, the lenders party
from time to time thereto, Ableco Finance LLC and GMAC Commercial Finance LLC (the &#147;Financing
Agreement&#148;). Amendment No.&nbsp;3 modified certain definitions used in the Financing Agreement and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;5, 2008, we entered into a fourth amendment to the Financing Agreement (&#147;Amendment No.
4&#148;). Under Amendment No.&nbsp;4, a new $5.0&nbsp;million term loan (&#147;Term Loan D&#148;) was provided to the
Company. A 100% participation interest in Term Loan D was purchased by an affiliate of Sun Mackie,
LLC, the controlling shareholder of the Company (&#147;Sun Mackie&#148;). Amendment No.&nbsp;4 also provided that
the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and the lenders waive compliance with certain
financial covenants set forth in the Financing Agreement, specifically, (a)&nbsp;the consolidated
leverage ratio, the fixed charge coverage ratio and the EBITDA covenants (collectively the
&#147;Designated Financial Covenants&#148;) and any Default and Event of Default that may have arisen prior
to, or that existed on the effective date of the amendment as a result of any failure to comply
with the Designated Financial Covenants for the fiscal quarter ending September&nbsp;30, 2008. See (b)

Events) for further information regarding Term Loan
D and these amendments.

with the ability to borrow up to an additional $8.2&nbsp;million. Interest is due quarterly and is
based on JP Morgan Chase Bank&#146;s prime rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 3.0%. If we were to breach our
covenants or otherwise default on our obligations under the Financing Agreement governing this
facility (which includes clauses that can cause a default based on a material adverse change to our
business or otherwise subjectively accelerate the due date of our debt), we may be unable to borrow
additional amounts under the line of credit. See Liquidity discussion in Note 2.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pursuant to Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to the Financing Agreement, the interest rates applicable to the
existing term loans provided under the Financing Agreement increased from and after the date of
Amendment No.4 to the following rates: (a)&nbsp;Term Loan A bears interest at the JP Morgan Chase Bank&#146;s
reference rate, base rate or prime rate plus 1.10% or LIBOR plus 3.6%, (b)&nbsp;Term Loans B bear

75% in Term Loan C.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company issued to our controlling shareholder, Sun Mackie LLC, a $7.5
million Convertible Senior Subordinated Secured Promissory Note due 2012 (the &#147;Note&#148;) that is
secured by all of the assets of the Company now owned and thereafter acquired. The Note bears
interest at a rate of 15.25% per annum, payable in kind until maturity, and is convertible into
common stock stated at a conversion price of $5.00 but is adjusted
upon the occurance of certain events. We paid Sun Mackie a fee of $150,000 upon
issuance of the Note.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company applied the guidance of Emerging Issue Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) No.&nbsp;98-5, &#147;Accounting for
Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingent Adjustable Conversion
Ratios&#148; and EITF No.&nbsp;00-27, &#147;Application of Issue No.&nbsp;98-5 Certain Convertible Instruments&#148; and
concluded that the convertible debt included a beneficial conversion feature, which was valued at
$6.7&nbsp;million using the fair value of the stock at the commitment date and the stated conversion
rate. This amount was determined by multiplying the shares to be issued upon conversion times the
intrinsic value per share. The number of shares to be issued upon conversion was calculated by
adding the proceeds of $7.5&nbsp;million plus the unpaid accrued interest at maturity and dividing this
sum by the stated conversion price of $5.00. The intrinsic value per share is the difference
between the $7.35 fair-value of the stock at commitment date less the stated conversion price. The
beneficial conversion feature was recorded as a debt discount, credited to additional paid in
capital, and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Note using the effective
interest method. As a result of options granted at an exercise price of $4.61 per share during the
third quarter of 2008, the conversion price was reset at an amount of $4.96 per share.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Senior Subordinated Secured Promissory Note, the Company
must maintain compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including but not limited to
cross-covenants with the Company&#146;s Senior Subordinated debt and timely filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Company had not incurred an &#147;event of
default&#148; because the holder of the notes had not provided written notice to the Company of any such
default.

Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 (the &#147;Form&nbsp;10-K&#148;). Amendment No.&nbsp;2 had

Exchange Commission noting, among other things, that the Company failed to include in its Form 10-K
the Item&nbsp;9A management report on internal control over financial reporting. On March&nbsp;24, 2009, the
Company filed Amendment No.&nbsp;3 to the Form 10-K which amended the disclosure contained in Amendment
No.&nbsp;2 relating to the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and

conclusion that the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2007. For additional information see Part&nbsp;I, Item

Company filed an amendment to the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 which amended the
disclosure therein in Item&nbsp;4 relating to the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures and an amendment to the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 which amended the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;6, 2008, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing a reorganization of
its marketing, sales and engineering functions. The reorganization was approved by the Board of
Directors on the same day. Under the new organization, product strategy, development and marketing
for the company&#146;s MI Brands and Pro business will be managed by separate, dedicated product
management teams, while marketing communications for all LOUD brands will be consolidated and
managed by a shared marketing support team. The Company&#146;s worldwide engineering resources will be
scaled accordingly to support a more focused product development schedule. LOUD will also move
North American sales for its current captive sales force to a group of independent sales
representation firms and consolidate portions of its international sales force. The reorganization
is being implemented in response to the Company&#146;s strategic review. The Company&#146;s strategic review
determined that the current economic environment did not provide the potential to deliver an
acceptable long-term return on investment under the Company&#146;s then-existing structure and that the
Company&#146;s remaining resources would be better spent addressing market needs and revenue
opportunities in the musical instrument and pro audio equipment industry with a more focused development schedule.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The restructuring generated a net reduction of approximately 90 employees, or approximately 18% of
the regular full-time staff, and was implemented by the end of 2008. The Company undertook the
reduction in workforce in order to conserve cash and align its workforce within its anticipated
staffing needs in light of its strategic refocusing of its development programs. The Company
expects to incur charges relating to the restructuring plan of approximately $2.0&nbsp;million, of which
approximately $1.5&nbsp;million relates to one-time termination benefits. These charges will result in
cash expenditures, of which the Company expects $1.0&nbsp;million will be incurred in the fourth quarter
of 2008 and the remainder will be incurred during 2009. The above estimated costs and charges are
preliminary and may vary materially based on various factors, including the timing and success of
the Company&#146;s reduction in workforce, the reorganization of its marketing, sales and engineering
functions, and changes in management&#146;s assumptions and projections.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;6, 2008, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing it had entered into
Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to its financing agreement dated March&nbsp;30, 2007. Under Amendment No.&nbsp;4, a new $5.0
million term loan (&#147;Term Loan D&#148;) was provided to LOUD. The proceeds of the Term Loan D are
required to be used to repay a portion of the revolving loan under the Financing Agreement, pay
fees and costs associated with the Amendment, and fund working capital to the extent there are no
outstanding revolver loans on the effective date of the Amendment. A 100% participation interest
in Term Loan D was purchased by an affiliate of Sun Mackie. Term Loan D bears interest at a per
annum rate of 15.0% to be paid-in-kind by being added to the principal balance of Term Loan D on a
monthly basis on the first day of each month after the effective date of the Amendment. The
maturity date of Term Loan D is March&nbsp;30, 2012, at which time all principal and all accrued and
unpaid interest are payable in cash. LOUD has paid an amendment fee to the Administrative Agent of
$250,000 at closing, and to Sun Capital Partners Management, LLC, an affiliate of Sun Mackie, an
amendment fee of $250,000, which amount is due and payable in accordance with the following
schedule: (i) $62,500 upon entry into the Amendment, (ii) $62,500 on December&nbsp;31, 2008, (iii)
$62,500 on March&nbsp;31, 2009 and (iv) $62,500 on June&nbsp;30, 2009. Term Loan D is subject to the same
terms and certain events and defaults as term loans covered by the Financing Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amendment No.&nbsp;4 also provided that the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent and the lenders

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;6, 2008, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that the Board of
Directors received a proposal from Sun Mackie to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company not held by Sun Mackie for a price of $1.45 in cash per share. The Board of
Directors appointed a Special Committee of independent directors to consider and evaluate the
proposal. The Special Committee retained independent financial advisors and legal counsel to
assist in its work. On January&nbsp;15, 2009, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing
that the Company and Sun Mackie determined they are unable to complete the proposed going private
transaction. In the same Form 8-K, the Company disclosed the determination by the Company&#146;s Board
of Directors to cause the delisting of the Company&#146;s common stock from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC
(the &#147;NASDAQ&#148;) and to terminate the registration of its common stock under the Securities Exchange

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing a disruption in the
supply of the Company&#146;s products that resulted in a backlog of orders. The Company learned
recently that the supplier had ceased manufacturing products for the Company due to financial
difficulties the supplier is experiencing. The supplier had been producing products for the
Company under contract since December&nbsp;2000. Products produced by this supplier represented
approximately 39.5% of the Company&#146;s net sales in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, and
approximately 46.7% of the Company&#146;s net sales in the six month period ended June&nbsp;30, 2008. For
additional information, see Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our operating performance will be
adversely affected by difficulties we are experiencing with a major contract supplier&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;7, 2009 the Company completed an additional reorganization of its administration and
operational support functions. The restructuring generated a net reduction of 40 employees, or
approximately 8% of the regular full-time staff. The Company undertook the reduction in workforce
in order to conserve cash and align its workforce within its anticipated staffing needs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;2, 2009, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the results of an
independent investigation by the audit committee, the Company&#146;s plans relating to the completion
and filing of corrective amendments to the Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs referred to in the first
paragraph of this Note 11, and an update regarding its plans to delist its common stock from the
NASDAQ and deregister its common stock under the Exchange Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;26, 2009, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing that it had
received a staff determination letter from the NASDAQ indicating that the Company&#146;s common stock
would be delisted on March&nbsp;3, 2009 due to the Company&#146;s failure to timely submit an acceptable plan
to regain compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4310(c)(14) related to its failure to file a
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 by the prescribed due date.
On March&nbsp;3, 2009, the Company&#146;s common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is highly leveraged and maintains a senior credit facility that is critical to its
liquidity, growth and ongoing operations. The Financing Agreement (as defined in Note 8
(Financing) to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report) relating to this credit
facility requires us to maintain financial ratios such as a fixed charge coverage ratio and a
consolidated leverage ratio. We are also required to meet certain EBITDA targets and adhere to
certain capital expenditure limits. The Financing Agreement also restricts our ability to obtain
additional financing, pay dividends, or enter into mergers and acquisitions. From time to time, we
have been in breach of certain of the financial covenants in the Financing Agreement and have
received forbearances from the lenders, entered into waiver agreements with respect to the defaults
and amended the Financing Agreement. For example, we were in default on certain of the financial
covenants as of the end of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. In connection with Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to the Financing Agreement
entered into on November&nbsp;5, 2008, we received a waiver from the lenders for those defaults and
amended various covenants. The specific defaults and the Amendment are more fully described in
Note 8 (Financing) and Note 11 (Subsequent Events) to the financial statements included elsewhere
in this report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with the terms of the Financing Agreement
in future periods. As discussed in Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our operating performance
will be adversely affected by difficulties we are experiencing with a major contract supplier&#148;.
One of our major suppliers suspended manufacturing products for us in the fourth quarter of 2008.
The adverse impacts of the global economic downturn on our operating performance coupled with the
disruption in supplies of products previously manufactured by this supplier is likely to cause us
to be out of compliance with certain covenants under the Financing Agreement by the end of the
first quarter of 2009 unless the lenders agree to waive such noncompliance or to amend the
covenants. While these developments raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to
continue as a going concern, the Company initiated an ongoing comprehensive supply recovery plan in
December, 2008 and has already established two new contract manufacturing relationships, scheduled
a $3.1&nbsp;million investment in tooling, expanded capacity at a company-owned facility, and recovered
production on 36 models which represent 35% of the 102 models to be recovered.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If we do breach the covenants under the Financing Agreement relating to our senior secured credit
facility, we intend to seek waivers from the lenders under the Financing Agreement or to negotiate
an amendment to the Financing Agreement covenants. However, there is no assurance that the lenders
would grant waivers, agree to amend the covenants under the Financing Agreement, allow us to
continue borrowing under this credit facility or otherwise agree to restructure our debt or that we
would be able to obtain other financing. Moreover, it is likely that external sources of financing
necessary to restructure our debt would not be available and our controlling shareholder has not
provided any assurances that it will provide additional financial support in the future. If we
breach the covenants under our Financing Agreement or otherwise default on our debt, the lenders
have a variety of remedies against us, including accelerating all amounts outstanding under the
credit facility so that such amounts come due immediately and foreclosing on their security
interests, which would allow the lenders (or a third party purchaser in a foreclosure sale) to take
possession of all of our assets; any of such steps could impede our ability to continue as a going
concern. If the supply disruption leads to an event of default under the Financing Agreement that
is not cured or waived, and the lenders accelerate the indebtedness outstanding under the Financing
Agreement, it is likely that the Company would not have sufficient cash flow from operations or
access to other sources of financing necessary to meet its cash requirements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We believe there have been no additional significant changes in our critical accounting policies
during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 from that
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, except as follows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. In testing for
potential impairment of goodwill, we estimate the fair value of our businesses to which goodwill
relates and determine the carrying value (book value) of the assets and liabilities related to
those businesses. The first step in the goodwill impairment analysis is to determine if the
estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of each reporting unit. If the estimated fair
value is less than the carrying value for that particular reporting unit, then we are required to
perform a second step in the goodwill impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of all
identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation for an acquired business to determine the estimated fair value of goodwill. The amount
of any goodwill impairment is determined through this process.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment at
many points during the analysis. In determining the carrying value of the reporting units, we had
to apply judgment to allocate the assets and liabilities.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of
our annual or periodic
analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these reporting units.
Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and
estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units, there is significant judgment in
determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units over their remaining useful lives.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Based on numerous factors which arose in the current quarter, including but not limited to
deteriorating economic conditions and related challenges in the markets and industry in which we
compete, the Company&#146;s recent performance relative to historical operating results, projected
future operating results, and troubles with a major supplier, we performed goodwill impairment
testing for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the purpose of this analysis, our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the
income approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future
discounted cash flows, and the market approach. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not
completed this analysis due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of
the goodwill of each reporting unit. However, based on the work performed to date, we have
concluded that an impairment loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, we
have recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately
$15.5&nbsp;million, representing
our best estimate of the impairment loss during the third quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We expect to finalize our goodwill impairment analysis during preparation of financial statements
for the fourth quarter of 2008. There could be adjustments to the goodwill impairment charge when
the goodwill impairment test is completed. Any adjustments to the Company&#146;s preliminary estimates
as a result of completing this evaluation will be recorded in our financial statements for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP and SEC regulations for interim financial statements. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including
revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, intangible assets,
income taxes and general business contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Results of operations for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, showed a net loss of
approximately $23.4&nbsp;million, an increase of $21.5&nbsp;million from a net loss of $1.9&nbsp;million for the
comparable period in 2007. Operating loss for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 was $19.6
million compared to operating income of $0.7&nbsp;million in the comparable period in 2007. The
increase in net loss and operating loss is primarily due to a slower retail summer in 2008 that had
fewer than normal customers entering into the musical instrument retail establishments, the
continued challenge in delivering products to our customers due to supply chain constraints, and
the write down of inventories and intangibles associated with the sale of the distribution business
as described in Note 11 (Subsequent Events) to the financial statements included elsewhere in this
report. In addition, the net loss was impacted significantly by the impairment of goodwill which
arose in the current quarter, due to deteriorating economic conditions, related challenges in the
markets and industry in which we compete, the Company&#146;s recent performance relative to historical
operating results, projected future operating results, and troubles with a major supplier.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Net sales decreased by 11.7% to $46.9&nbsp;million during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 from
$53.1&nbsp;million in the comparable period in 2007. The decrease is primarily due to a slower retail
summer in 2008 that had fewer than normal customers entering into the musical instrument retail
establishments and the continued challenge in delivering products to our customers due to supply
chain constraints. Due to deteriorating economic conditions as described in Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A &#147;Risk
Factors &#151; Our operating performance, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted
by deteriorating economic conditions&#148;, net sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined
significantly compared to net sales in the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, and the Company
expects that net sales for 2009 will continue to be adversely impacted by this factor and by the
supply chain disruption described in Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our operating performance
will be adversely affected by difficulties we are experiencing with a major contract supplier&#148;.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Gross profit dollars decreased to $11.9&nbsp;million, or 25.4% of net sales, in the three months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2008 compared to $15.1&nbsp;million, or 28.5% of net sales, in the three months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2007. The decrease in gross profit percentage for 2008 primarily resulted from
supply chain constraints, the declining economic environment, and the write down of approximately
$1.7&nbsp;million in inventory associated with the sale of the distribution business, slightly offset by
the positive effects of a better mix of product sales.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Selling, general and administrative expenses were relatively unchanged, increasing by $0.4&nbsp;million

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Restructuring Costs</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We incurred approximately $86,000 in restructuring costs during the three month period ended
September&nbsp;30, 2008, primarily attributed to employee severance and related costs for 13 terminated
employees. In the comparable period in 2007, we incurred approximately $158,000 in restructuring
costs, primarily related to the closure of our inside sales group in St. Louis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;6, 2008, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing a reorganization of
its marketing, sales and engineering functions. The reorganization was approved by the Board of
Directors on the same day. Under the new organization, product strategy, development and marketing
for the company&#146;s MI Brands and Pro business will be managed by separate, dedicated product
management teams, while marketing communications for all LOUD brands will be consolidated and
managed by a shared marketing support team. The Company&#146;s worldwide engineering resources will be
scaled accordingly to support a more focused product development schedule. LOUD will also move
North American sales for its current captive sales force to a group of independent sales
representation firms and consolidate portions of its

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">international sales force. The reorganization is being implemented in response to the Company&#146;s
strategic review. The Company&#146;s strategic review determined that the current economic environment
did not provide the potential to deliver an acceptable long-term return on investment under the
Company&#146;s then-existing structure and that the Company&#146;s remaining resources would be better spend
addressing market needs and revenue opportunities in the musical instrument and pro audio equipment
industry with a more focused development schedule.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The restructuring generated a net reduction of 90 employees, or approximately 18% of the regular
full-time staff, and was implemented by the end of 2008. The Company undertook the reduction in
workforce in order to conserve cash and align its workforce within its anticipated staffing needs
in light of its strategic refocusing of its development programs. The Company expects to incur
charges relating to the restructuring plan of approximately $2.0&nbsp;million, of which approximately
$1.5&nbsp;million relates to one-time termination benefits. These charges will result in cash
expenditures, of which the Company expects $1.0&nbsp;million will be incurred in the fourth quarter and
the remainder will be incurred during 2009. The above estimated costs and charges are preliminary
and may vary materially based on various factors, including the timing and success of the Company&#146;s
reduction in workforce, the reorganization of its marketing, sales and engineering functions, and
changes in management&#146;s assumptions and projections.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;7, 2009, the Company completed an additional reorganization of its administration and
operational support functions. The restructuring generated a net reduction of 40 employees, or
approximately 8% of the regular full-time staff. The Company undertook the reduction in workforce
in order to conserve cash and align its workforce within it anticipated staffing needs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Impairment of Goodwill</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of numerous factors which arose in the third quarter of 2008, including but not limited
to deteriorating economic conditions and related challenges in the markets and industry in which we
compete, coupled with the Company&#146;s recent performance relative to historical operating results,
projected future operating results, and troubles with a major supplier, we performed goodwill
impairment testing (and reflected a write off) during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. See
Note 7 (Goodwill) for further discussion. The Company had no similar expense related to
impairment of goodwill in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Impairment of Intangibles</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The impairment of intangible assets is associated with the sale of the distribution business. See
Note 11 (Subsequent Events) to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Other Expense</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Other expense was $3.7&nbsp;million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 compared to $3.1
million in the comparable period last year. The increase in other expense of $0.6&nbsp;million is
primarily due to the cost associated with the Sun Mackie $7.5&nbsp;million Convertible Senior
Subordinated Secured Promissory Note due 2012 issued on March&nbsp;18, 2008, and is carried on the
Company&#146;s balance sheet net of discount related to a beneficial conversion feature. The discount
is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the note.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The majority of our debt has variable interest rates, and the interest expense component of other
income (expense)&nbsp;in future quarters will be affected by changing interest rates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Income tax expense for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 was $0.1&nbsp;million compared to a
benefit of ($0.4) million for the comparable period in 2007. The primary components of the 2008
income tax include income tax expense of $0.4&nbsp;million related to Canadian and UK jurisdictions
where we have taxable income, partially offset by a deferred tax benefit in the United Kingdom of
$0.3&nbsp;million recorded as a result of the partial amortization of the intangible assets for book
purposes which reduces the deferred tax liability recorded as a result of the acquisition of Martin
Audio. The primary components of the 2007 benefit is the deferred tax benefit recorded as a result
of the amortization of the deferred tax liability recorded as a result of the acquisition of Martin
Audio.

$154.6&nbsp;million in the comparable period in 2007. The change in sales is related to strength in
certain core brands of Mackie, Ampeg, and EAW, as well as, strong international sales during the
first six months of the year partially offset by slower third quarter sales primarily due to a
slower retail summer in 2008 that had fewer than normal customers entering into the musical
instrument retail establishments and the continued challenge in delivering products to our
customers due to supply chain constraints.

30, 2008 from $43.3&nbsp;million, or 28.0% of net sales, in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007.
Gross profit was primarily affected by the positive effect of a better mix of product sales in
spite of supply constraints and the declining economic environment partially offset by the write
down of approximately $1.7&nbsp;million in inventory associated with the sale of the distribution
business. In addition, gross profit was affected by slowing sales in the third quarter as

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Restructuring costs were $0.4&nbsp;million in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, primarily
attributable to employee severance and related costs for 23 employees. Restructuring costs were
$1.7&nbsp;million in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007. The 2007 costs were primarily
attributable to severance accruals related to the closure and overseas transfer of our domestic
manufacturing plants and the closure of our St. Louis Music engineering functions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;6, 2008, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the reorganization
of its marketing, sales and engineering functions as described above under &#147;&#151;Three Months Ended
September&nbsp;30, 2008 vs. Three Months Ended September&nbsp;30, 2007 &#151; Restructuring Costs&#148;.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As a result of numerous factors which arose in the third quarter of 2008, including but not limited
to deteriorating economic conditions and related challenges in the markets and industry in which we
compete, coupled with, the Company&#146;s recent performance relative to historical operating results,
projected future operating results, and troubles with a major supplier, we performed goodwill
impairment testing (and reflected a write off) during the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. See
Note 7  (Goodwill) for further discussion. The Company had no similar expense related to
impairment of goodwill in 2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The impairment of intangible assets is associated with the sale of the distribution business. See

$10.2&nbsp;million in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007. The increase in other expense of $0.4
million is primarily due to an increase in foreign
exchange losses.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Income tax expense for the first nine months of 2008 was $0.3&nbsp;million compared to income tax
benefit of ($0.5) million for the comparable period in 2007. The primary components of the 2008
expense are obligations to foreign tax authorities related to the Company&#146;s Canadian and UK
jurisdictions where we have taxable income, and an increase to our income tax reserve partially
offset by the deferred tax benefit recorded in the United Kingdom as a result of the partial
amortization of the intangible assets for book purposes which reduces the deferred tax liability
recorded as a result of the acquisition of Martin Audio. The primary components of the 2007
benefit is the deferred tax benefit recorded as a result of the partial amortization of the
intangible assets giving rise to a deferred tax liability recorded as a result of the acquisition
of Martin Audio. This deferred tax benefit was further impacted based on the enactment of a U.K.
tax law during the quarter, which reduced the statutory tax rate. This deferred tax benefit was
partially offset by current taxes due from our foreign subsidiaries and an increase to our income
tax reserve.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Cash provided by operating activities was $0.1million in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008,
compared to cash provided by operating activities of $0.5&nbsp;million for the comparable period in
2007. The net loss for the first nine months of 2008 was approximately $27.0&nbsp;million including
$4.0&nbsp;million in depreciation and amortization, $0.4&nbsp;million in amortization of deferred financing
costs, $1.4&nbsp;million in the write down of intangibles related to the sale of the distribution

business, $15.5&nbsp;million in the write down of goodwill, $1.6&nbsp;million in non-cash interest expense,
and $0.2&nbsp;million in stock based compensation expense. In the first nine months of 2008, an
increase in prepaid other current assets of $2.4&nbsp;million accompanied by a decrease in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities of $10.5&nbsp;million used cash, while a decrease to accounts receivable
of $1.0&nbsp;million and inventories of $14.3&nbsp;million, provided cash. The net loss for the first nine
months of 2007 was $10.6&nbsp;million that included $3.6&nbsp;million in depreciation and amortization, $2.9
million in amortization and write off of deferred financing costs, $0.2&nbsp;million in stock- based
compensation expense, a gain on asset dispositions of $0.5&nbsp;million, and $0.2&nbsp;million of non-cash
interest expense. In the first nine months of 2007, a decrease to inventories and accounts
receivable of $10.2&nbsp;million and $3.3&nbsp;million, respectively, provided cash while decreases to
accounts payable, accrued liabilities and payable to our former Italian subsidiary of $7.7&nbsp;million

first nine months of 2008 primarily related to purchases of new product tooling. The cash used in

months of 2008 is primarily attributable to the Sun Mackie Convertible Debt of $7.5&nbsp;million which
was used to partially pay down the existing debt and line of credit. Cash provided in the first
nine months of 2007 is primarily attributable to a new credit
facility of $102.0 million. During the first

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The primary sources of liquidity for our business are cash flow generated from operations,
borrowings under the Company&#146;s Financing Agreement relating to its senior credit facility, and
loans from our controlling shareholder and its affiliates in the form of a convertible note, as
well as participations by such affiliate in our senior credit facility. We expect that our
principal uses of cash will be debt service requirements, working capital, capital expenditures and
funds used for our restructuring plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Although borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations have
historically been adequate to fund our debt service requirements, working capital requirements and
capital expenditures, the continued weakness in the economy and the continued challenge in
delivering products to our customers due to supply chain constraints, has resulted in a decrease in
cash flows from operations. As described under Note 8 (Financing) and Note 11 (Subsequent Events)
to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report, it was necessary for Sun Mackie, our
controlling shareholder, to loan the Company $7.5&nbsp;million in the form of a convertible note in
March&nbsp;2008, which was used to repay revolving senior indebtedness. In November&nbsp;2008, it was
necessary for us to borrow an additional $5&nbsp;million as a Term Loan D under our senior credit
facility, pursuant to Amendment No.&nbsp;4 to the Financing Agreement relating to our senior credit
facility. An affiliate of Sun Mackie purchased a 100% participation in that loan. We have
therefore depended in large part on our controlling shareholder and balance sheet management for
additional liquidity. Under Amendment No.&nbsp;4, the proceeds of Term Loan D were required to be used
to repay a portion of the revolving loan under the Financing Agreement, pay fees and costs
associated with the Amendment, and fund working capital to the extent there are no outstanding
revolver loans on the effective date of the Amendment. Term Loan D bears interest at a per annum
rate of 15.0% to be paid-in-kind by being added to the principal balance of Term Loan D on a
monthly basis on the first day of each month after the effective date of the Amendment. The
maturity date of Term Loan D is March&nbsp;30, 2012, at which time all principal and all accrued and
unpaid interest are payable in cash. The Company paid an amendment fee to the Administrative Agent
of $250,000 at closing, and to Sun Capital Partners Management, LLC, an affiliate of Sun Mackie, an
amendment fee of $250,000, of which: (i) $62,500 was paid upon entry into the Amendment, (ii)
$62,500 was paid on December&nbsp;31, 2008, (iii) $62,500 is due on March&nbsp;31, 2009 and (iv) $62,500 is
due on June&nbsp;30, 2009. Term Loan D is subject to the same terms and certain events and defaults as
term loans covered by the Financing Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If global economic conditions continue to deteriorate and / or we experience further operational
declines, we may need additional sources of liquidity in order to continue to operate our business
and execute our restructuring plans. Given the unprecedented instability in worldwide credit
markets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing and, if we
can obtain financing, that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us. See Part&nbsp;II, Item
1A &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our operating performance, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely
impacted by deteriorating economic conditions&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with the terms of the Financing Agreement
in future periods. As discussed in Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our operating performance
will be adversely affected by difficulties we are experiencing with a major contract supplier&#148;, one
of our major suppliers of products ceased manufacturing products for us in the fourth quarter of
2008. The adverse impacts of the global economic downturn on our operating performance coupled
with the disruption in supplies of products previously manufactured by this supplier is likely to
cause us to be out of compliance with certain covenants under the Financing Agreement by the end of
the first quarter of 2009 unless the lenders agree to waive such noncompliance or to amend the
covenants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If we do breach the covenants under the Financing Agreement relating to our senior secured credit
facility, we intend to seek waivers from the lenders under the Financing Agreement or to negotiate
an amendment to the Financing Agreement covenants. However, there is no assurance that the lenders
would grant waivers, agree to amend the covenants under the Financing Agreement, allow us to
continue borrowing under this credit facility or otherwise agree to restructure our debt or that we
would be able to obtain other financing. Moreover, it is likely that external sources of financing
necessary to restructure our debt would not be available and our controlling shareholder has not
provided any assurances that it will provide additional financial support in the future. If we
breach the covenants under our Financing Agreement or otherwise default on our debt, the lenders
have a variety of remedies against us, including accelerating all amounts outstanding under the
credit facility so that such amounts come due immediately and foreclosing on their security
interests, which would allow the lenders (or a third party purchaser in a foreclosure sale) to take
possession of all of our assets; any of such steps could impede our ability to continue as a going
concern. If the supply disruption leads to an event of default under the Financing Agreement that
is not cured or waived, and the lenders accelerate the indebtedness outstanding under the Financing
Agreement, it is likely that the Company would not have sufficient cash flow from operations or
access to other sources of
financing necessary to meet its cash requirements.

management&#146;s conclusion that the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure

an amendment to the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 which amended the disclosure
therein in Item&nbsp;4 relating to the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures

therein in Item&nbsp;4 relating to the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (the &#147;Form&nbsp;10-Q/As&#148;). The Form&nbsp;10-Q/A&#146;s included

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December&nbsp;17, 2008, the Company reported that it has
experienced a backlog of orders with a significant contract manufacturer in China due to
manufacturing delays, which impacted sales and margins beginning in the second quarter of 2008.
This backlog continued to negatively impact the Company&#146;s operations in the second half of 2008.
While the Company had thought such manufacturing delays would be temporary, the Company learned in
the fourth quarter that this supplier had ceased manufacturing products for the Company due to
difficulties the supplier is experiencing. The supplier has been producing products for the
Company since December&nbsp;2000. For the three month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, net
sales of products manufactured by this supplier were $18.1&nbsp;million and $14.8&nbsp;million, or 38.6% and
27.9% of net sales, respectively. For the nine-month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007,
net sales of products manufactured by this supplier were $69.1&nbsp;million and $57.6&nbsp;million, or 44.3%

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency rates and interest
rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our $93.4&nbsp;million term loans have variable interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates
affect interest paid on debt and we are exposed to interest rate risk. For the quarter ended
September&nbsp;30, 2008, an increase in the average interest rate of 10%, i.e. from 10.5% to 11.6%,
would have resulted in an approximately $0.8&nbsp;million increase in net loss before income taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A majority of our sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and during the three months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2008 approximately 34.3% of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies. We
ordinarily do not engage in hedging as a means to minimize our foreign currency risk and, instead,
mitigate that exposure by limiting the portion of our sales that are denominated in other than U.S.
Dollars. Assuming the same level of foreign currency denominated sales as in the three months
ended September, 2008, a 10% decline in the average exchange rates for all these currencies would
have caused a decline of approximately $1.5&nbsp;million, or 3.1%, of our sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The majority of our products are manufactured by foreign third-party contract manufacturers with
the majority of the contracts denominated in U.S. Dollars. Foreign third-party manufacturing
creates risks that include fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could affect the price we
pay for our product. Our two largest foreign contract manufacturers&#146; products represented 62.9% of
our net sales for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. A 10% increase to the cost of the
product sold that was manufactured by these two manufacturers would have resulted in an increase to
cost of sales for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 of approximately $2.9&nbsp;million.

management, with former outside counsel and with a representative of the Company&#146;s independent

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course
of business. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings will not have
a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1A. Risk Factors</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously
disclosed in the Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our operating performance, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely impacted by
deteriorating economic conditions.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Deteriorating economic conditions in the United States and other markets pose numerous risks to our
business. A slowdown or decline in U.S. and foreign economic growth is likely to adversely affect
consumer confidence, disposable income or spending. Because most of our products are discretionary
goods, our business may be particularly impacted by a slowdown in consumer spending. A slowdown in
consumer spending could result in reduced sales of our products and increased price competition.
Deteriorating economic conditions could adversely impact our retail customers, leading to longer
sales cycles, reduced orders and greater difficulty managing inventory levels and collecting
receivables. In addition, because we depend to a significant extent on borrowings under our senior
credit facility and from our controlling shareholder, declines in our operating performance due to
deteriorating economic conditions or otherwise could negatively impact our financial condition and
liquidity. Tighter credit conditions could make it more difficult for us to obtain the debt
financing we need to operate our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our operating performance will be adversely affected by difficulties we are experiencing with a
major contract supplier.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has experienced a backlog of orders with a significant contract manufacturer in China,
which impacted sales and margins beginning in the second quarter of 2008. This backlog continued to
negatively impact the Company&#146;s operations in the third quarter of 2008 and is expected to
negatively impact the Company&#146;s operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. While the Company had
thought such manufacturing delays would be temporary, the Company learned in the fourth quarter
that this supplier had ceased manufacturing products for the Company due to difficulties the
supplier is experiencing. For the three month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, net sales
of products manufactured by this supplier were $18.1&nbsp;million and $14.8&nbsp;million, or 38.6% and 27.9%
of net sales, respectively, during those periods. For the nine-month periods ended September&nbsp;30,
2008 and 2007, net sales of products manufactured by this supplier were $69.1&nbsp;million and $57.6
million, or 44.3% or 37.2% of net sales, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Although the Company has not terminated its manufacturing agreement with this supplier, the Company
is in the process of evaluating its options and arranging for alternative contract manufacturers to
resume production of the products previously manufactured by this supplier. The Company is also
evaluating the feasibility of moving some of the production to manufacturing facilities owned by
the Company. The timing for resuming production of the products previously manufactured by this
supplier is uncertain, and will depend to a significant extent on the Company&#146;s ability to obtain
certain custom tooling used to manufacture the Company&#146;s products. Although the Company has held
discussions with the supplier regarding the return of the custom tooling in the possession of the
supplier, which belongs to the Company, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to obtain much
if any of such tooling from the supplier. In the mean time, the Company has contracted with third
parties to manufacture replacement custom tooling relating to higher volume, higher margin products
previously manufactured by this supplier. Production of these products is expected to be phased in
over the course of 2009. As circumstances allow, the Company may obtain replacement custom tooling
and initiate production of other products previously manufactured by this supplier.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the disruption in the supply of the Company&#146;s products, the Company anticipates a
significant decline in net sales in 2009, with the most significant impact to be felt in the first
and second quarters of 2009. Until the Company has better

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">visibility into when shipments of the affected products will resume, it is unable to estimate the
full impact from this disruption. The Company has identified and begun to implement changes to its
business and operating plans for 2009 in order to reduce costs in response to the anticipated
decline in net sales. In addition to the anticipated decline in net sales, this supply disruption
will create numerous risks for the Company, including the following:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our business may be adversely affected by recent restructurings.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As we announced on November&nbsp;6, 2008, we recently implemented a restructuring of our marketing,
sales and engineering functions. In addition, we completed an additional restructuring of our
administrative and operational support functions in January&nbsp;2009. Implementation of these
restructurings will likely place significant strains on management and may impair our marketing,
sales, engineering, administrative and operational support functions, as well as our relationships
with customers and suppliers. In addition, the costs of implementing these restructurings will
result in charges that will adversely affect our results of operations and may exceed our current
estimates. These restructurings may not result in all of the cost savings and operational and
strategic benefits that we currently anticipate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>The liquidity of our shares of common stock will be adversely affected by our delisting from the
NASDAQ Stock Market and the plan to deregister.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February&nbsp;26, 2009, we announced that we had
received a staff determination letter from NASDAQ indicating that the Company&#146;s common stock would
be delisted on March&nbsp;3, 2009 due to the Company&#146;s failure to timely submit an acceptable plan to
regain compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule&nbsp;4310(c)(14) related to its failure to file a
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 by the prescribed due date.
On March&nbsp;3, 2009, the Company&#146;s common stock was delisted from the NASDAQ. This involuntary
delisting superseded the Company&#146;s decision, as disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on January&nbsp;15, 2009, to voluntarily delist its common stock from the NASDAQ Stock
Market LLC. In the January&nbsp;15, 2009 Form 8-K, we also disclosed the decision to terminate the
registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act. The Company&#146;s common stock may be quoted
over-the-counter on the Pink Sheets LLC if market makers commit to make a market in the Company&#146;s
shares. Pink Sheets LLC is an electronic network through which participating broker-dealers can
make markets, and enter orders to buy and sell shares of issuers. However, the Company can provide
no assurance that trading in its common stock will continue on the Pink Sheets or otherwise.
Moreover, the Company&#146;s common stock may become more illiquid now that it is no longer traded on
NASDAQ, which could negatively impact market prices for the Company&#146;s stock and make it more
difficult for shareholders to sell their shares. Moreover, once we complete the deregistration of
our common stock under the Exchange Act, we will no longer be required to file periodic and other
reports with the SEC. As a consequence, there will be little if any public information available
about the Company&#146;s business, operations, financial condition, results of operations or other
matters.
