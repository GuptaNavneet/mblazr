listing of our shares on a national securities exchange. Our board of directors recognized that certain potential liquidity events may be enhanced if we first became self-administered. For example, it is widely believed that our shares would be more
highly valued by the market if we became self-administered and those individuals responsible for running our Company were our own employees rather than those of our external advisor. Also, we may be able to sell our Company for a higher price or
attract institutional equity as a self-administered company if the purchaser desires our management team and employees, along with our assets. </TD></TR></TABLE>

Compensation Committee&#146;s primary focus is to assist our board of directors in fulfilling its responsibilities with respect to officer and director compensation. The Compensation Committee assists our board of directors in this regard when
necessary by: (1)&nbsp;reviewing and approving our corporate goals with respect to compensation of officers and directors; (2)&nbsp;recommending to our board of directors compensation for all non-employee directors, including board of directors and
committee retainers, meeting fees and equity-based compensation; (3)&nbsp;administering and granting equity-based compensation to our employees and our Former Advisor, employees of our Former Advisor and affiliates based upon recommendations from
our Former Advisor; and (4)&nbsp;setting the terms and conditions of such equity-based compensation in accordance with our Employee and Director Long-Term Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). The Compensation Committee fulfills these
responsibilities in accordance with current laws, rules and regulations. Prior to the Self Administration and Investment Management Transaction, the Compensation Committee concluded that, because the Compensation Committee only needed to address
issues related to director compensation while we were an externally advised REIT, a Compensation Committee charter was not necessary. Now that we are self-administered, the Compensation Committee will review the need for a charter and, if and when
adopted, will disclose a copy of such charter to our stockholders pursuant to applicable SEC rules. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Compensation Committee

limited to setting director compensation and administering the Plan. Our non-director officers have no role in determining or recommending director compensation. Directors who are also officers of the Company do not receive any special or additional
remuneration for services on our board of directors or any of its committees. Each non-employee independent director received compensation for services on our board of directors and its committees as provided below. </P>

which vest ratably over a period of four years from the date such independent director was appointed to our board of directors (the &#147;Initial Restricted Stock Awards&#148;). We also issued additional awards of 1,250 shares of restricted stock to
each independent director upon each of their re-elections to our board of directors, which vest ratably over a period of four years from the date of re-election (the &#147;Annual Restricted Stock Awards&#148;). Each independent director has received
a total of 8,750 shares of restricted stock, 5,625 of which have vested to each independent director as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. Both the Initial Restricted Stock Awards and the Annual Restricted Stock Awards are subject to a number of other
conditions set forth in such awards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Plan was approved and adopted prior to the commencement of our initial public offering in order
to (1)&nbsp;provide incentives to individuals who are granted awards because of their ability to improve our operations and increase profits; (2)&nbsp;encourage selected persons to accept or continue employment with us or with our Former Advisor or
its affiliates that we deem important to our long-term success; and (3)&nbsp;increase the interest of our independent directors in our success through their participation in the growth in value of our stock. Pursuant to the Plan, we may issue
options, stock appreciation rights, distribution equivalent rights and other equity-based awards, including, but not limited to, restricted stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The total number of shares of our common stock (or common stock equivalents) reserved for issuance under the Plan is equal to 10% of our
outstanding shares of stock at any time, but not to exceed 10,000,000 shares. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, there were 5,685,278 shares remaining for issuance under the Plan. The term of the Plan is 10 years. Upon our earlier dissolution or liquidation,
upon our reorganization, merger or consolidation with one or more corporations as a result of which we are not the surviving corporation, or upon sale of all or substantially all of our properties, the Plan will terminate, and provisions will be
made for the assumption by the successor corporation of the awards granted or the replacement of the awards with similar awards with respect to the stock of the successor corporation, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares
and exercise prices. Alternatively, rather than providing for the assumption of awards, the Compensation Committee may either (1)&nbsp;shorten the period during which awards are exercisable, or (2)&nbsp;cancel an award upon payment to the
participant of an amount in cash that the Compensation Committee determines is equivalent to the amount of the fair market value of the consideration that the participant would have received if the participant exercised the award immediately prior
to the effective time of the transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event that the Compensation Committee determines that any distribution,
recapitalization, stock split, reorganization, merger, liquidation, dissolution or sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, or other similar corporate transaction or event, affects the stock such that
an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to an award, then the Compensation Committee shall, in such manner as it may
deem equitable, adjust the number and kind of shares or the exercise price with respect to any award. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Terms of Director Compensation

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beginning in 2011 and continuing through August&nbsp;31, 2014, our Chairman of the board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and President,
through certain entities, participated in a tenant reinsurance program whereby tenants of our self storage facilities and tenants of other operators participating in the program can purchase insurance to cover damage or destruction to their property
while stored at such facilities. Such entities have invested in a Cayman Islands company (the &#147;Reinsurance Company&#148;) that will reinsure a portion of the insurance required by the program insurer to cover the risks of loss at participating
facilities in the program. The program insurer provides fees (approximately 50% of the tenant premium paid) to us as owner of the facilities. The Reinsurance Company may be required to fund additional capital or entitled to receive distributions of
profits depending on actual losses incurred under the program. Effective August&nbsp;31, 2014, we acquired the interest in the Reinsurance Company from an affiliate of Mr.&nbsp;Schwartz. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we
recorded revenue of approximately $1.6 million, $1.3 million and $0.4 million respectively, in connection with this tenant reinsurance program. </P>

second quarter of 2013, our Chairman of the board of directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, and our Senior Vice President &#151; Property Management and the President of our property manager, purchased minority interests in a company (the
&#147;Auction Company&#148;) that serves as a web portal for self storage companies to post their auctions online instead of using live auctions conducted at the self storage facilities. Once the contents of a storage unit are sold at auction, we
will pay the Auction Company a service fee based upon the sale price of the unit. Collectively, these officers owned 18% of the voting interests in the Auction Company. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we incurred approximately $50,000 in
auction fees with the Auction Company. On January&nbsp;1, 2014, the Auction Company merged with another similar company. Such officers&#146; collective ownership in the new combined company was reduced to approximately 9%. In addition,
Mr.&nbsp;Schwartz serves on the Board of Advisors of the Auction Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Preferred Equity Investment in Strategic Storage Growth Trust, Inc. </B></P>

may be invested in one or more tranches on or before January&nbsp;31, 2015, to be used solely for investments in self storage properties, as described in the underlying documents, in exchange for up to 724,000 preferred units of limited partnership

damage or destruction to their property while stored at such facilities. In addition to the tenant insurance revenues we already receive pursuant to the program, we will now be entitled to receive our share of distributions of any profits generated

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Introduction </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our board of directors
declared an amendment and restatement of our Charter advisable on September&nbsp;4, 2014. Our board of directors directed that proposals to amend and restate the Charter be submitted for stockholder consideration at the 2014 Annual Meeting. Please
see the form of Third Articles of Amendment and Restatement attached hereto as <U>Exhibit A</U> and which has been marked to show the proposed changes from our existing Charter as <U>Exhibit B</U>. The descriptions set forth in Proposals 2.A through
2.D collectively summarize the amendments that our board of directors approved in the Third Articles, each of which is qualified in its entirety by reference to <U>Exhibit A</U>, which you should read in its entirety. If all of the proposals are
approved and the Third Articles take effect, our board of directors will amend our bylaws to eliminate inconsistencies resulting from the proposed amendments and to make certain other changes to our bylaws. </P>

directors has been and is continuing to explore various strategic alternatives ultimately designed to provide stockholder liquidity at some point in the future, including, but not limited to, a potential listing of our shares on a national
securities exchange. Our board of directors recognizes that certain potential liquidity events may be enhanced if we first become self-administered. For example, it is widely believed that our shares would be more highly valued by the market if we
become self-administered and those individuals responsible for running our Company were our own employees rather than those of our external advisor. Also, we may be able to sell our Company for a higher price or attract institutional equity as a
self-administered company if the purchaser desires our management team and employees, along with our assets. Therefore, effective August&nbsp;31, 2014, we became self-administered by acquiring substantially all of the operating assets of SSH, the
parent company of our sponsor, pursuant to a contribution agreement. Please see the section titled &#147;Acquisition of Operational Assets of Strategic Storage Holdings and Other Transactions&#148; on pages 33-36 of this proxy statement for more
information regarding the Self Administration and Investment Management Transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>NASAA REIT Guidelines </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Charter currently includes certain provisions required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines which apply to REITs with shares that are publicly
registered with the SEC but are not listed on a national securities exchange. Our Charter was designed to be consistent with other non-traded REITs and to satisfy certain requirements imposed by state securities administrators in connection with our
public &#147;best efforts&#148; offerings.&nbsp;More specifically, as a condition to selling our common stock in certain jurisdictions, certain state securities administrators required us to include in our Charter provisions consistent with those
stated in the NASAA REIT Guidelines, which they deemed were applicable to a REIT that is making a public offering of securities which are not listed for trading on a national securities exchange or designated for quotation on an over-the-counter
market.&nbsp;We are no longer engaged in this type of public offering and we do not intend to raise capital publicly as an unlisted company in the future, and therefore, it is not necessary that our Charter conform to the requirements of the NASAA
REIT Guidelines. We believe that the limitations included in our Charter which derive from the NASAA REIT Guidelines, at a minimum create interpretive questions resulting in uncertainty which could impair our ability to operate as we move
forward.&nbsp;We believe that by removing the NASAA-mandated provisions and amending our Charter so that it instead follows Maryland law, under which we are organized, the resulting charter will be more similar to those of publicly traded REITs
incorporated in Maryland. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Provisions Regarding the Former Advisor and its Affiliates </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current Charter contemplates us being advised and managed by an external advisor and includes a number of provisions that govern the
relationship between us and the Former Advisor and its affiliates. Among other things, these provisions limit the term of our Advisory Agreement to no more than one year, require the Advisory Agreement be terminable on 60 days&#146; notice and
without penalty, require our independent directors to supervise the Former Advisor, and limit the amount of fees we may pay and expenses we can reimburse to the Former Advisor. The Third Articles remove these provisions because they became
inapplicable upon our becoming self-administered and are inconsistent with charters of publicly-traded REITs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our current
Charter contains numerous provisions that limit our ability to engage in transactions with, among other persons, our Former Advisor, our Former Sponsor, directors or officers or </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
any of their respective affiliates. In general, these provisions require that such transactions (which are referred to herein as &#147;affiliated transactions&#148;) be approved by our
independent directors. They also contain limitations on the substantive aspects of the affiliated transactions themselves, such as restrictions on the consideration to be paid for services provided or assets acquired from or sold to such persons.
These provisions address a number of transactions including joint ventures, sales and leases to and from us, and loans to and from us, as well as general restrictions on affiliated transactions with the Former Advisor and its affiliates. The Third
Articles remove these limitations because they became inapplicable upon our becoming self-administered and are inconsistent with charters of listed REITs. Additionally, Maryland law contains restrictions on our ability to engage in related-party
transactions. Under Maryland law, a transaction with any of our directors or any other entity in which any of our directors is a director or has a material financial interest is not voidable so long as the transaction is approved by a majority of
our disinterested directors and the transaction is fair and reasonable to us. Our board of directors does not believe that the removal of these limitations related to the Former Advisor and its affiliates will have an adverse effect on us because of
the protections otherwise afforded by Maryland law. This change will enable us to have a charter appropriate for a self-administered company and listed company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This change does, however, also pose a risk, as the proposed Charter revisions would also remove limitations on transactions with any director
(not just those affiliated with the Former Advisor). Although we believe that those restrictions are overly restrictive (and not typical of listed REIT charters) and could prevent us from effecting a transaction that would otherwise be in our best
interest, removal of those restrictions would permit us (without stockholder approval) to enter into a transaction with a director unaffiliated with us. We believe that this risk is small because we have no intentions of effecting transactions that
are currently prohibited by our Charter with our directors unaffiliated with us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Lastly, our current Charter provides that it is not a
proper purpose of the Company to make any significant investment unless it has been recommended by the Former Advisor. This provision has the effect of enabling our officers and directors to pursue opportunities that might have been suitable for the
Company if they were not recommended to the Company by the Former Advisor. Our Third Articles remove this provision because it became inapplicable upon our becoming self-administered. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Provisions Regarding Investor Suitability </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current Charter imposes certain suitability and minimum investment requirements on investors in our common stock in accordance with the
NASAA REIT Guidelines. The Third Articles remove the requirements in Section&nbsp;5.8 of Article V of the Charter that stockholders meet certain suitability criteria regarding suitability and minimum investment of stockholders. The removal of these
requirements generally will provide stockholders with greater ability to sell shares, since prospective buyers would no longer be subject to the financial suitability standards imposed by the NASAA REIT Guidelines. In addition, the removal of these
provisions would eliminate the minimum stockholding requirements, thus permitting transfers of shares in any amount. Furthermore, the removal of these provisions eliminates the requirement that our Former Sponsor or anyone selling shares on our
behalf or on behalf of our Former Sponsor make a determination that the purchase of our shares is a suitable and appropriate investment for the prospective stockholder (although we are currently not selling shares). Rather, prospective stockholders
of their financial advisers, or both, would determine for themselves whether an investment in the Company is a suitable and appropriate investment. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Provisions Regarding Directors </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As
required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines, our current Charter contains several provisions relating to our directors and specifically our independent directors. We are proposing to remove these NASAA-mandated provisions, which relate to the number and
independence of directors; the term and experience of directors; the committees of the board of directors; the fiduciary obligations of the board of directors; and approval of certain matters by the independent directors. Additional information is
provided below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Number and Independence of Directors.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Articles delete the requirement that our board of
directors be comprised of at least three directors. This is a NASAA REIT Guidelines requirement and under the MGCL, our board of directors may be comprised of as few as one director. The Third Articles will continue to require that a majority of our
board of directors be composed of independent directors; however, independence will no longer be determined based on the NASAA REIT Guidelines, rather independence will be determined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. We
currently evaluate the independence of our directors under both our current Charter definition (as required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines) and the NYSE standard. All of our current independent directors meet the NYSE standard for independence, and we
do not expect that removing NASAA-imposed director requirements will affect the composition of our board of directors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Term and
Experience of Directors.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Articles delete the NASAA REIT Guidelines requirement in Section&nbsp;7.2 of Article VII of our current Charter that each director hold office for one year, until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies, as this provision is typically included in a company&#146;s bylaws. In addition, the Third Articles deletes the NASAA REIT Guidelines requirements in Section&nbsp;7.3 of
Article VII of our current Charter that any director have at least three years of relevant experience demonstrating the knowledge and experience required to successfully acquire and manage the Company&#146;s assets and that at least one independent
director have at least three years of relevant real estate experience. This NASAA-mandated provision is more restrictive than what is required under the MGCL and any national exchange. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Committees.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Articles delete the NASAA REIT Guidelines requirement that a majority of the members of all committees
(even ad hoc committees) be independent directors as such requirement is more stringent than national securities exchange rules with respect to committee composition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Fiduciary Obligations.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Articles also delete the NASAA REIT Guidelines statement that directors serve in a
fiduciary capacity and have fiduciary duties. Under the MGCL, each director has a duty to act in good faith, with a reasonable belief that his or her action is in the Company&#146;s best interests and with the care of an ordinarily prudent person in
a like position under similar circumstances. This change is advisable as it is not desirable to establish multiple standards governing the duties of directors under Maryland law. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Approval of Independent Directors.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Articles delete the NASAA REIT Guidelines requirement that certain matters be
approved by the independent directors, which is more restrictive than requirements under Maryland law, in order to provide the customary flexibility of other REITs. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Provisions Regarding Investment Objectives and Limitations </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Investment Objectives.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Article IX of our current Charter contains a number of limitations and restrictions on our ability to
make certain types of investments (including investments in certain mortgage loans, unimproved property or equity securities), as required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines. Our board of directors believes that the elimination of these restrictions is
desirable as they will remove restrictions on potential transactions that could become available to us and that could be in our best interest. Although we have no intention of pursuing any of the investments currently limited by Article IX, we
believe that increased flexibility could be advantageous and that the limitations are rarely, if ever, found in the charter of a listed REIT. Nevertheless, the proposed Third Articles increase the risk that we will pursue transactions such as those
referenced above, which, if such investments perform poorly, could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of your investment in us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Indebtedness.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Article IX also limits our ability to incur indebtedness, as required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines. Currently,
our Charter prohibits us from incurring debt that would cause our borrowings to exceed 300% of our &#147;net assets&#148; unless a majority of the members of the board of directors approves the borrowing and such borrowing is disclosed in our next
quarterly report along with a justification for the excess. Although we currently have no intention of borrowing in excess of this amount, if the Third Articles are approved, this Charter restriction on our borrowings will be removed and there would
be no restriction on our leverage. Therefore, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in the amount of debt repayment. This, in turn, could increase our risk of default on our obligations and adversely affect our results of
operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholder. Despite these risks, we recommend this change because it increases our flexibility to incur debt that might be in our best interest and lessens the administrative burdens
associated with a higher debt level should we deem such debt to be in our best interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Issuance of Certain
Securities.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Article IX also limits our ability to issue certain securities, as required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines, including equity securities on a deferred-payment basis or other similar arrangement; debt securities in the absence
of adequate cash flow to cover debt service; equity securities that are assessable; and equity securities redeemable solely at the option of the holder. If the Third Articles are approved, these restrictions will be removed and our board of
directors will be able to issue the securities described above. Our board of directors recommends this change because it removes limitations on issuances of securities that our board of directors could determine to be in our best interest. Although
we believe this flexibility is advantageous, the proposed charter amendment does increase the risk that we will issue securities that could negatively impact the value of your investment. In particular, the issuance of debt securities in the absence
of adequate cash flow to cover the debt service would adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Similarly, if we issued equity securities redeemable solely at the option of the holder, we may be required to redeem
securities at a time when we would otherwise prefer to utilize our cash for other purposes and this could also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. We have no current intention to issue any securities
the issuance of which would be prohibited under our current Charter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Provisions Regarding Roll-Up Transactions </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stockholder Meetings.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Articles provide for the removal of the NASAA REIT Guidelines requirements in
Section&nbsp;11.1 of Article XI of the Charter that (a)&nbsp;an annual meeting of stockholders be held no less than 30 days after delivery of the Company&#146;s annual report, (b)&nbsp;a director receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares present in order to be elected as the MGCL requires only a plurality of the votes cast, and (c)&nbsp;a special meeting of stockholders be called upon request of the holders of at least 10 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote
(under the MGCL, the percentage required to call a meeting can be as high as a majority). In addition, the provisions relating to notice of stockholder meetings and quorum at such meetings are deleted as these provisions are typically included in a

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Voting Limitations.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Articles provide for the removal of the NASAA REIT Guidelines restrictions in
Section&nbsp;11.4 of Article XI of the Charter on voting of common stock by directors, the Former Advisor and their affiliates, regarding the removal of any of them or a transaction between the Company and any of them, as these are not customary

provisions relating to our stockholders&#146; ability to inspect the Company&#146;s records and access its stockholder list. The provisions currently in our Charter were included to meet requirements imposed by the NASAA REIT Guidelines and are not
consistent with the charters of other Maryland corporations, which generally rely on Maryland law and their bylaws to govern access to a stockholder list. If approved, the rights of stockholders to inspect and copy certain corporate documents,
including the ability to obtain a list of stockholders, will be limited to the rights provided for under the MGCL, which are more restrictive than those currently included in our Charter. </P>

that are not contained in the MGCL, including restrictions on exculpation and indemnification of officers and affiliated directors whose liability was the result of negligence or misconduct and independent directors whose liability was the result of
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The advancement of litigation-related expenses to directors and officers is also significantly restricted under Section&nbsp;12.4 of Article XII of our current Charter. For instance, in a

Maryland corporation may include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from (a)&nbsp;actual receipt of an improper
benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b)&nbsp;active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. In addition, Section&nbsp;2-418 of the MGCL generally permits a Maryland
corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or threatened to be
made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a)&nbsp;the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (i)&nbsp;was committed in bad
faith or (ii)&nbsp;was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b)&nbsp;the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c)&nbsp;in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or
officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. Finally, Section&nbsp;2-418 of the MGCL provides that a Maryland corporation may pay or reimburse reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer who is a party to
a proceeding in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the corporation of (a)&nbsp;a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary
for indemnification and (b)&nbsp;a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met. </P>

conform our Charter more closely with those of our competitor REITs who are listed on an exchange, and to retain and recruit qualified and experienced officers and directors, we recommend amending Article XII of the Charter to provide directors and
officers the maximum exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses permitted under Maryland law, including removing the NASAA REIT Guidelines requirement that any director and officer insurance purchased by the Company be consistent with
the restrictions on indemnification imposed by the NASAA REIT Guidelines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Conforming Changes and Other Ministerial Modifications </B></P>

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to maintain the Company&#146;s tax-preferred REIT qualification under the Code, (i)&nbsp;any five individuals, as defined
under the Code, may not own 50% or more of the shares of the Company&#146;s stock and (ii)&nbsp;the Company must have at least 100 stockholders, during specified periods of time. In addition, the Code imposes limitations on stock ownership by the
Company, and its affiliates, of the Company&#146;s tenants. To help assure that the Company meets these requirements and thereby preserve the value of the Company&#146;s REIT qualification for all our stockholders, our Charter has included ownership
and transfer restrictions for the Company&#146;s stock since the time we were formed and first raised capital. Although we believe that no violation of the aforementioned stock ownership limitations for REITs under the Code has occurred under the
current Charter, we also believe the proposed amendment to the ownership and transfer restrictions for our stock accord with practices that have evolved in the charters of REITs like the Company and will help to mitigate further any risk to the
Company&#146;s REIT qualification. Under the current Charter, the general ownership limit is set as 9.8% of our stock, and we are not proposing to amend that general limit. If adopted, this proposal would amend the ownership and transfer
restrictions in Section&nbsp;6.1.1 of Article VI of the Third Articles to state that after an automatic transfer of shares to a charitable trust has been made, to the extent a violation of certain transfer and ownership restrictions would
nonetheless be continuing (for example, where the ownership of shares by a single charitable trust would violate the prohibition in the Charter on transfers that would result in our Company being closely held), shares will be transferred to a number
of charitable trusts such that there is not a continuing violation of the transfer and ownership restrictions applicable for qualification as a REIT. </P>

Audit Committee Charter adopted by the board of directors of the Company, the Audit Committee&#146;s primary function is to assist the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by overseeing the independent registered public
accounting firm, the audit and financial reporting process and the system of internal control over financial reporting that management has established and by reviewing the financial information to be provided to the Company&#146;s stockholders and
others. The Audit Committee is composed of two independent directors and met four times during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. Management of the Company has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process,
including the system of internal control over financial reporting. Membership on the Audit Committee does not call for the professional training and technical skills generally associated with career professionals in the field of accounting and
auditing. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm devotes more time and has access to more information than does the Audit Committee. Accordingly, the Audit Committee&#146;s role does not provide any special assurances with
regard to the financial statements of the Company, nor does it involve a professional evaluation of the quality of the audits performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. </P>

the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K with management, including a discussion of the quality and acceptability of the financial reporting and controls of the Company, the reasonableness of significant
judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:11pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Audit Committee discussed with the Company&#146;s independent
