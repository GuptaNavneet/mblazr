to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by overseeing: (1)&nbsp;the independent auditors and reviewing the financial information to be provided to the Company&#146;s stockholders and others; (2)&nbsp;the system
of internal control over financial reporting which management has established; and (3)&nbsp;the audit and financial reporting process. The Audit Committee is composed of two Independent Directors and met five times during the year-ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010. Management of the Company has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal control over financial reporting. Membership on the Audit Committee does not
call for the professional training and technical skills generally associated with career professionals in the field of accounting and auditing. In addition, the independent auditors devote more time and have access to more information than does the
Audit Committee. Accordingly, the Audit Committee&#146;s role does not provide any special assurances with regard to the financial statements of the Company, nor does it involve a professional evaluation of the quality of the audits performed by the
independent auditors. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In this context, in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and

the Company, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. </FONT></P>

with our Advisor or its affiliates that we deem important to our long-term success; and (3)&nbsp;increase the interest of our Independent Directors in our success through their participation in the growth in value of our stock. Pursuant to the Plan,
