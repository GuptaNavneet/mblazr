the Company and the ability of the candidate to attend board of directors meetings regularly and to devote an appropriate amount of effort in preparation for those meetings. It also is expected that independent directors nominated by our board of

stockholders and other interested persons for director nominees who meet the established director criteria. In order for a stockholder to make a nomination, the stockholder must satisfy the procedural requirements for such nomination as provided in
the Company&#146;s bylaws, which include, among other things, providing the nominee&#146;s name, age, address, and ownership of the Company&#146;s stock. Such nominations must also be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to be

with respect to the stock of the successor corporation, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and exercise prices. Alternatively, rather than providing for the assumption of awards, the Compensation Committee may either
(1)&nbsp;shorten the period during which awards are exercisable, or (2)&nbsp;cancel an award upon payment to the participant of an amount in cash that the Compensation Committee determines is equivalent to the amount of the fair market value of the

others, same store NOI (net operating income) growth, FFO (funds from operations), same store revenue growth, tenant insurance penetration, same store occupancy and strategic goals, and intends to utilize a mix of these objective metrics and a

percent of which vest upon the Company&#146;s achieving certain performance goals. For 2015, such goal is tied to achieving certain levels of FFO. The Compensation Committee believes that an emphasis on performance measures will drive our long-term

the executive officer&#146;s employment under various conditions. The level of severance pay depends upon the circumstances of the executive officer&#146;s termination of employment. For example, if the executive officer were terminated by the
Operating Partnership without Cause (as defined in the severance agreements) and not in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in the severance agreements), then the executive officer would be entitled to a separation payment equal to the
base salary for the applicable year and target bonus for the first fiscal year and average bonus thereafter (1.25 times these amounts for Mr.&nbsp;McClure and 3.0 times these amounts for Mr.&nbsp;Schwartz). If, within two years of a Change in
Control, the executive officer were terminated by the Operating Partnership without Cause or the executive officer terminates his or her employment for Good Reason (as defined in the severance agreements), then the executive officer would be
entitled to a severance payment equal to 2 times the base salary for the applicable year and target bonus for the first fiscal year and average bonus thereafter (2.5 times these amounts for Mr.&nbsp;McClure and 3.0 times these amounts for
Mr.&nbsp;Schwartz). Upon death or disability of the executive officer, the executive officer (or his or her estate) will be entitled to receive a severance payment equal to the base salary through the end of the applicable year plus any accrued but
unpaid target bonus. If the executive officer terminates his or her employment voluntarily or if the executive officer were terminated by the Operating Partnership for Cause (as defined in the severance agreements), then such executive officer will

Management </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Compensation Committee was involved in negotiating each of the severance agreements with our named executive officers.
The Compensation Committee believes that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage our employees to take excessive or unnecessary risks and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In making this
assessment, the Compensation Committee considered a variety of factors, including base salary, annual cash incentive compensation and long-term equity incentive compensation opportunities available to our named executive officers. The committee
believes that the combination of the compensation elements should lead to executive and employee behavior that is consistent with our overall objectives and risk profile. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Section&nbsp;162(m)</U>. Under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to herein as the
&#147;Code,&#148; certain limits are placed on the tax deductibility of compensation paid to our certain of our executives unless the compensation meets the requirement for &#147;performance-based compensation&#148; as set forth in the Code and the
related regulations. Our Compensation Committee has considered the possible effect of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code in designing our compensation programs and policies. Further, as long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not pay taxes at
the corporate level and, therefore, losing the deductibility of compensation does not have a significant adverse impact on the Company. Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code did not limit our ability to take a tax deduction for all of the compensation
paid to these executives for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the extent that any part of our compensation expense is not
deductible under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, we might be required to pay certain distributions to our stockholders to maintain our status as a REIT. Also, any compensation allocated to our taxable REIT subsidiaries whose income is subject to
federal income tax would result in an increase in income taxes due to the inability to deduct the compensation. The Compensation Committee will continue to take into account the materiality of any deductions that might be lost as well as the broader
interests to be served by paying competitive compensation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Section&nbsp;409A</U>. Section&nbsp;409A of the Code may affect the federal
income tax treatment of most forms of deferred compensation by accelerating the timing of the inclusion of the deferred compensation to the recipient for federal income tax purposes and imposing an additional federal income tax on the recipient

managing our day-to-day operations. Each of our executives was an employee of an affiliate of our Former Advisor and was compensated by this affiliate for services performed by our Former Advisor on our behalf. On September&nbsp;4, 2014, effective
as of August&nbsp;31, 2014, we entered into the Self Administration and Investment Management Transaction. As a result of these agreements and amendments, we began to perform certain functions previously provided to us by our Former Advisor. We
hired, and entered into severance agreements with, our executives and began paying compensation to these persons. As a result, the table below shows the compensation for services in all capacities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014

received various fees and expenses under the terms of our Former Advisory Agreement. Our Former Advisory Agreement also required our Former Advisor to reimburse us to the extent that offering expenses, including sales commissions, dealer manager
fees and organization and offering expenses, were in excess of 15% of gross proceeds from our follow-on public offering of common stock (SEC File No.&nbsp;333-168905) for a maximum of 110,000,000 shares of common stock, consisting of 100,000,000
shares for sale to the public (our &#147;Primary Offering&#148;) and 10,000,000 shares for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (collectively, our &#147;Offering&#148;). Subsequent to the termination of our Offering on
September&nbsp;22, 2013, we have determined that these expenses did not exceed 15% of gross proceeds from the Offering. In addition, certain organization and offering costs of the Offering were paid by our Former Advisor on our behalf and reimbursed
to our Former Advisor from the proceeds of the Offering. Organization and offering costs consisted of all expenses (other than sales commissions and the dealer manager fee) paid by us in connection with the Offering, including our legal, accounting,
printing, mailing and filing fees, charges of our escrow holder and other accountable offering expenses, including, but not limited to, (i)&nbsp;amounts to reimburse our Former Advisor for all marketing related costs and expenses such as salaries

property we acquired plus reimbursement of any acquisition expenses the Former Advisor incurred. Our Former Advisor also received a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.0% of the average invested assets, as defined in the Former
Advisory Agreement, of our assets, excluding those properties acquired through our mergers with REIT I and REIT II and the SS I, DST, Madison DST, Colonial DST and SF DST acquisitions; provided, however, that if the average invested assets, as
defined, of our assets exceeded $500 million, the monthly asset management fee would be reduced to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the average invested assets, as defined, of those assets exceeding $500 million unless our modified funds from operations (as
defined in the Former Advisory Agreement), including payment of the fee, was greater than 100% of our distributions in any month (see footnote (2)&nbsp;in the following table for a discussion of the Former Advisor&#146;s permanent waiver of certain
asset management fees). The monthly asset management fees for our properties acquired through our mergers with REIT I and REIT II and the SS I, DST, Madison DST, Colonial DST and SF DST acquisitions was equal to 2.0% of the gross revenues from the
properties and was paid to affiliates of our Former Sponsor. Under our Former Advisory Agreement, and our articles of incorporation, as amended, our Former Advisor may have received disposition fees in an amount equal to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;3.0%
of the contract sale price for each property we sell, or (ii)&nbsp;one-half of the competitive real estate commission, as long as our Former Advisor provided substantial assistance in connection with the sale. The disposition fees paid to our Former
Advisor were subordinated to the receipt of our stockholders of a 6% cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on such stockholders&#146; invested capital. The total real estate commissions paid (including disposition fees paid to our Former
Advisor) may not have exceeded the lesser of a competitive real estate commission or an amount equal to 6.0% of the contract sale price of the property. </P>

first real estate asset), our Former Advisor was required to reimburse us the amount by which our aggregate annual operating expenses, as defined, exceeded the greater of 2% of our average invested assets or 25% of our net income, as defined, unless
a majority of our independent directors determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For any fiscal quarter for which total operating expenses for the 12 months then ended exceeded the limitation,
we were required to disclose this fact in our next quarterly report or within 60 days of the end of that quarter and send a written disclosure of this fact to our stockholders. In each case, the disclosure was required to include an explanation of
the factors that the independent directors considered in arriving at the conclusion that the excess expenses were justified. Our aggregate annual operating expenses, as defined, did not exceed the thresholds described above. </P>

a period of two years after the termination of the Amended Advisory Agreement, from soliciting or hiring any employee of, or person performing services on behalf of, our Former Advisor. </P>

distributions, each of which were outlined further in the Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, the First REIT I OP Agreement Amendment, and the First REIT II OP Agreement Amendment, if (1)&nbsp;our shares of common stock were
listed on a national exchange, (2)&nbsp;we terminated our Former Advisory Agreement (other than a voluntary termination by mutual assent), (3)&nbsp;we liquidated our portfolio, or (4)&nbsp;we entered into an Extraordinary Transaction, as defined in

(1)&nbsp;listed our shares of common stock on a national exchange, (2)&nbsp;liquidated our portfolio, or (3)&nbsp;entered into an Extraordinary Transaction resulting in a return to our stockholders in excess of an amount per share that will be
determined by our independent directors. Such one-time cash distribution would be paid as part of the complete redemption of our Former Advisor&#146;s special limited partnership interest in our Operating Partnership and would be up to the aggregate
amount of all unreturned and unreimbursed capital invested by our Former Advisor and its affiliates in us, our Operating Partnership, our Former Advisor and affiliates, relating in any way to our business or our Operating Partnership&#146;s business

Offering and a dealer manager fee equal to up to 3.0% of gross proceeds from sales in the Primary Offering under the&nbsp;terms of our Dealer Manager Agreement. Our Dealer Manager entered into participating dealer agreements with certain other
broker-dealers which authorized them to sell our shares. Upon sale of our shares by such broker-dealers, our Dealer Manager re-allowed all of the sales commissions paid in connection with sales made by these broker-dealers. Our Dealer Manager was
also permitted to re-allow to these broker-dealers a portion of the 3.0% dealer manager fee as marketing fees, reimbursement of certain costs and expenses of attending training and education meetings sponsored by our Dealer Manager, payment of
attendance fees required for employees of our Dealer Manager or other affiliates to attend retail seminars and public seminars sponsored by these broker-dealers, or to defray other distribution related expenses. Our Dealer Manager also received
reimbursement of bona fide due diligence expenses; however, to the extent these due diligence expenses cannot be justified, any excess over actual due diligence&nbsp;expenses will be considered underwriting compensation subject to a 10% FINRA
limitation and, when aggregated with all other non-accountable expenses, may not exceed 3% of gross offering proceeds from sales in the Primary Offering. The Dealer Manager Agreement terminated upon the termination of our Offering. </P>

the properties under our property management agreement. In the event that our Property Manager assisted with the development or redevelopment of a property, we may have been required to pay a separate market-based fee for such services. As a
condition of the REIT II merger transaction, our Property Manager agreed to waive the monthly property management fees for the REIT II properties until the FFO, as defined in the merger agreement, of those properties reached $0.70 per share (which

defined in the Executive Officer Severance Agreements), then the executive officer would be entitled to a separation payment equal to the base salary for the applicable year and target bonus for the first fiscal year and average bonus thereafter
(1.25 times these amounts for Mr.&nbsp;McClure and 3.0 times these amounts for Mr.&nbsp;Schwartz). If, within two years of a Change in Control, the executive officer were terminated by the Operating Partnership without Cause or the executive officer
terminates his or her employment for Good Reason (as defined in the Executive Officer Severance Agreements), then the executive officer would be entitled to a severance payment equal to 2 times the base salary for the applicable year and target
bonus for the first fiscal year and average bonus thereafter (2.5 times these amounts for Mr.&nbsp;McClure and 3.0 times these amounts for Mr.&nbsp;Schwartz). Upon death or disability of the executive officer, the executive officer (or his or her

officer were terminated by the Operating Partnership for Cause (as defined in the Executive Officer Severance Agreements), then such executive officer will only be entitled to $10,000. In each of the foregoing circumstances, if the executive officer
violates any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Executive Officer Severance Agreements, that executive officer&#146;s right to receive severance payments pursuant to the Executive Officer Severance Agreements will end immediately. </P>

tranches, to be used for investments in self storage properties, as described in the SST II Unit Purchase Agreement, in exchange for up to an aggregate of 2.6&nbsp;million preferred units of limited partnership interest of the SST II Operating
Partnership (the &#147;SST II Preferred Units&#148;), each having a liquidation preference of $25.00 per Preferred Unit (the &#147;SST II Liquidation Amount&#148;), plus all accumulated and unpaid distributions. The SSTI Preferred Investor is

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beginning in 2011, our Chief Executive Officer and President, through certain entities, began participating in a tenant reinsurance program
whereby tenants of our self storage facilities are able to purchase insurance to cover damage or destruction to their property while stored at our facilities. Such entities invested in a Cayman Islands company (the &#147;Reinsurance Company&#148;)
that reinsures a portion of the insurance required by the program insurer to cover the risks of loss at participating facilities in the program. The program insurer provides fees (approximately 50% of the tenant premium paid) to us as owner of the
facilities. The Reinsurance Company may be required to fund additional capital or may be entitled to receive distributions of profits depending on actual losses incurred under the program. Effective August&nbsp;31, 2014, we acquired such interest
from our Chief Executive Officer and President. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded revenue of approximately $1.3 million, $1.6 million and $1.3 million respectively, in connection with this tenant reinsurance
program while it was owned by such affiliates. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we recorded approximately $0.7 million in revenue from the program insurer, while we owned the tenant reinsurance interest. </P>

second quarter of 2013, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and our Senior Vice President &#150; Property Management and the President of our Property Manager, purchased noncontrolling interests in a company (the &#147;Auction Company&#148;)
that serves as a web portal for self storage companies to post their auctions online instead of using live auctions conducted at the self storage facilities. Once the contents of a storage unit are sold at auction, we pay the Auction Company a
service fee based upon the sale price of the unit. On January&nbsp;1, 2014, the Auction Company merged with another similar company. Such officers&#146; collective ownership in the new combined company is now approximately nine percent. For the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred approximately $125,000 and $50,000, respectively, in auction fees with the Auction Company. </P>

firm&#146;s independence. In determining whether or not to pre-approve services, the Audit Committee considers whether the service is permissible under applicable SEC rules. The Audit Committee may, in its discretion, delegate one or more of its
members the authority to pre-approve any services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, provided such pre-approval is presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. </P>
