        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">This Proxy Statement is being furnished to shareholders of American Shared Hospital Services, a California corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled to be held at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco, Five Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA 94111 at 9:00&#160;a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on Friday, June&#160;21, 2019 and at any adjournments or postponement thereof&#8201; (the &#8220;Meeting&#8221; or &#8220;Annual Meeting&#8221;).

        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Revocability of Proxies </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">A proxy for use at the Meeting is enclosed. Any shareholder who executes and delivers such proxy may revoke it at any time prior to the final vote at the Meeting by filing with our Corporate Secretary either written instructions revoking such proxy or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Written notice of the death of the person executing a proxy, before the vote is counted, is tantamount to revocation of such proxy. A proxy may also be revoked by attending the Meeting and voting in person. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Solicitation of Proxies </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">This proxy solicitation is being made by the Board of the Company. The expense of the solicitation will be paid by the Company. To the extent necessary to assure sufficient representation at the Meeting, proxies may be solicited by any appropriate means by directors, officers and employees of the Company for shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (the &#8220;Common Shares&#8221;),. The Company will request that banks, brokers and other fiduciaries solicit their customers who beneficially own the Common Shares listed of record in names of nominees and, although there is no formal arrangement to do so, the Company will reimburse such persons for the reasonable expenses of such solicitation. In addition, the Company may engage a third party such as a proxy solicitor in connection with the solicitation of proxies if the Board </div>

The Company has engaged Laurel Hill Advisory to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Meeting. The Company agreed to pay Laurel Hill Advisory a fee of approximately $4,000 for its proxy solicitation services. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Outstanding Securities </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Board has fixed April&#160;24, 2019 as the Record Date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. At the close of business on the Record Date, there were 5,714,154 Common Shares issued and outstanding. The Common Shares are the only class of securities entitled to vote at the Meeting. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Voting Procedures </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Each holder of Common Shares will be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share standing in its name on the books of the Company as of the Record Date for the Meeting on each of the matters duly presented for a vote at the Meeting, except as indicated below in connection with the election of directors. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">In connection with the election of directors, shares are permitted to be voted cumulatively, if&#8201; (i)&#160;a shareholder present at the Meeting has given notice at the Meeting, prior to the voting, of such shareholder&#8217;s intention to vote its shares cumulatively and (ii) the names of the candidates for whom such shareholder desires to cumulate votes have been placed in nomination prior to the voting. If a shareholder has given such notice, all shareholders may cumulate their votes for candidates in nomination. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to give one nominee as many votes as is equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares owned by such shareholder or to distribute the same number of votes between two or more nominees. Discretionary authority to cumulate votes is hereby solicited by the Board. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">In connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies for use at the Meeting, the Board has designated Ernest A. Bates, M.D. and Craig K. Tagawa as proxies. Common Shares represented by properly executed proxies will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions specified thereon. If no instructions are specified, the Common Shares represented by any properly executed proxy will be voted FOR (1)&#160;the election of the six nominees for the Board named in the Proxy Statement, (2)&#160;the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company&#8217;s executive compensation, (3)&#160; &#8220;every year&#8221; as the frequency of the advisory shareholder vote on executive compenstion, (4) the approval of the amendment and restatement of the Company&#8217;s Incentive Compensation Plan, and (5)&#160;the ratification of the appointment of Moss Adams LLP as the Company&#8217;s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Board is not aware of any matters that will come before the Meeting other than as described above. However, if such matters are presented, the named proxies will, in the absence of instructions to the contrary, vote such proxies in accordance with the judgment of such named proxies with respect to any such other matter properly coming before the Meeting. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">All outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock represented by properly executed and unrevoked proxies received in time for the Meeting will be voted. A shareholder has the following voting options for the four proposals discussed herein: </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:8.39pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">A shareholder may, with respect to the election of directors, (i)&#160;vote for the election of all six director nominees named herein as directors, (ii) withhold authority to vote for all such director nominees or (iii) vote for the election of all such director nominees other than any nominee(s) with respect to whom the shareholder withholds authority to vote by so indicating in the appropriate space on the proxy. Withholding authority to vote for a director nominee will not prevent such director nominee from being elected. </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">A shareholder may, with respect to the proposal to ratify the appointment of Moss Adam LLP as the Company&#8217;s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, (i)&#160;vote for the ratification, (ii)&#160;vote against the ratification, or (iii) abstain. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">A proxy submitted by a shareholder may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by such proxy are not being voted by such shareholder with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when a broker is not permitted to vote Common Shares held in street name on certain matters in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of the Common Shares. The shares subject to any such proxy which are not being voted with respect to a particular matter (the &#8220;non-voted shares&#8221;) will be considered shares not present and entitled to vote on such matter, although such shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes and will count for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Abstentions are included in the determination of the number of shares represented at the Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The rules of the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) determine whether proposals presented at shareholder meetings are routine or non-routine. If a proposal is routine, a broker or other entity holding shares for a beneficial owner in street name may vote for the proposal without receiving voting instructions from the beneficial owner under certain circumstances. If a proposal is non-routine, the broker or other entity may vote on the proposal only if the beneficial owner has provided voting instructions. A &#8220;broker non-vote&#8221; occurs when the broker or other entity is unable to vote on a proposal because the proposal is non-routine and the beneficial owner does not provide any voting instructions. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Under the NYSE rules, the election of directors in an uncontested election (Proposal 1), the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 2), the advisory vote on the frequency of advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation (Proposal 3) and the amendment and restatement of the Company&#8217;s Incentive Compensation Plan (Proposal 4) are non-routine items. This means that brokers who do not receive voting instructions from their clients as to how to vote their clients&#8217; shares for these proposals cannot exercise their discretionary authority to vote these clients&#8217; shares for these proposals, in which case a broker non-vote will occur. Therefore, it is important that you instruct your broker as to how you wish to have your shares voted on these proposals, even if you wish to vote as recommended by the Board.

However, whether or not a particular frequency receives majority approval in accordance with the foregoing standards, the Board will have sole discretion to determine the actual frequency at which the required advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation will be conducted, because the shareholder vote on such frequency is only an advisory vote and is non-binding. The Board will consider the outcome of the advisory votes, including the number of votes received for each frequency, in determining the actual frequency to be adopted, and such determination will be disclosed in a Form 8-K to be filed in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). </div>

However, approval of these proposals also require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares necessary to constitute a quorum, and therefore abstentions and broker non-votes could prevent the approval of these proposals because they do not count as affirmative votes., provided that no broker non-votes are expected for Proposal 5 on the ratification of the appointment of the Company&#8217;s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. </div>

        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">The Board of Directors </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Company&#8217;s current Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that there shall be no less than five nor more than nine directors. The number of directors currently is fixed at eight. Each of the directors, except for John F. Ruffle and Stanley S. Trotman, Jr., is standing for re-election. Concurrently, with the Annual Meeting, the Board will reduce its size from eight to six directors. There are currently no vacancies on the Board. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Board Leadership Structure </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">For many&#160;years our founder, Ernest A. Bates, M.D., has served as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board believes that Dr.&#160;Bates&#8217; intimate knowledge of the Company&#8217;s business and customers, and his significant ownership of our Common Shares, closely align him with the interests of all of our constituencies and position him well to lead the Board, which in turn determines the Company&#8217;s overall direction. Since the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions are held by the same person, the Board has elected an independent, non-management director as Lead Director to coordinate the activities of the other non-management directors and preside at their meetings. Mr.&#160;Ruffle currently serves as Lead Director. The Board intends to appoint a new Lead Director immediately following the Annual Meeting. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Board&#8217;s Role in Risk Oversight </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Management, which is responsible for day-to-day risk management, continually monitors the material risks facing the Company, including strategic risks, operational risks, financial risks and legal and compliance risks. The Board is responsible for exercising oversight of management&#8217;s identification and management of, and planning for, those risks. The Board has delegated to certain committees oversight responsibility for those risks that are directly related to their area of focus. The responsibilities of the Board&#8217;s committees, and the areas of risk that they monitor, are described in detail in their charters. In summary, the Audit Committee oversees the preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements and the hiring and work of its independent auditors to mitigate the risk of non-compliance with the regulations of the SEC governing financial reporting. The Compensation Committee oversees the structure of the Company&#8217;s executive compensation program and has concluded that the program does not create a material risk that individuals will take excessive risks in order to impact their compensation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees Board organization, membership and structure, director and officer succession planning and corporate governance to promote compliance with the requirements of securities regulators and stock exchanges. While management has the primary responsibility for identifying, assessing and managing risk, the ability of the Board to oversee management in this area is enhanced by the active participation of Dr.&#160;Bates as Chairman. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Nominees for Directors </div>

Each of the persons identified below will be nominated for election to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor shall be elected and have qualified. Votes will be cast pursuant to the enclosed proxy in such a way as to effect the election of each of the persons named below or as many of them as possible under applicable voting rules. If a nominee is unable or unwilling to accept nomination for election as a director, it is intended that the proxy holders will vote for the election of such substitute nominee, if any, as shall be designated by the Board.

In doing so, the Compensation Committee customarily considers the comparative relationship of the recommended compensation to the compensation paid by other similarly situated companies, individual performance, tenure, internal comparability and the achievement of certain other operational and qualitative goals identified in the Company&#8217;s strategic plan. </div>

        <div style="width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-style:italic;">Directors&#8217; Annual Retainer Fees </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">In 2018, each non-employee director earned an annual retainer of&#8201; $20,000, subject to pro-ration for directors who either join or leave the Board during the year. Each director may choose to have the retainer paid in equal quarterly cash installments, or elect to defer all or part of the retainer by converting it to a restricted stock unit award pursuant to the terms of the Company&#8217;s Deferral Election Program, described below. Non-employee directors are reimbursed for the expenses they incur to attend Board meetings. No payment is made for attendance at meetings by any director who is a full-time employee of the Company. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-style:italic;">Deferral Election Program for Non-Employee Board Members </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Through its Deferral Election Program, the Company provides each non-employee Board member with the opportunity to defer all or a portion of the annual retainer fee he earns for service on the Board and Board committees. Such program allows each non-employee Board member to elect to convert all or a portion of such fee into a restricted stock unit award under the Company&#8217;s Incentive Compensation Plan. For each continuing Board member the deferral election must be filed on or before December&#160;31 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year for which the annual retainer fee is earned. For each newly elected Board member, the deferral election must be filed within 30&#160;days from the Board member&#8217;s commencement of Board service, and such election will apply to the portion of the retainer fee to be earned for the period of Board service measured from the first calendar quarter following the submission of the election to the Company. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">For each continuing non-employee Board member, the number of restricted stock&#160;units to be issued as a result of the deferral election is determined by dividing the dollar amount subject to the non-employee director&#8217;s election by the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock as of the first trading date in January of the calendar year in which the election is in effect. For each newly elected non-employee Board member, the number of restricted stock&#160;units to be issued as a result of the deferral election is determined by dividing the dollar amount subject to the non-employee director&#8217;s election by the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the first trading date of the first calendar quarter following the submission of the election to the Company. The issuance of the shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock that vest under the award is deferred until the Board member&#8217;s cessation of Board service. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Mr.&#160;Kelly, Dr.&#160;Larson, Ms.&#160;Lawrence, and Mr.&#160;Stachowiak made an election to defer their entire 2018 retainer by converting such fee into a restricted stock unit award under the Company&#8217;s Incentive Compensation Plan covering 7,844 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, respectively. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-style:italic;">Directors&#8217; Equity Grants </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Under the Incentive Compensation Plan, each individual who first becomes a non-employee director will, at the time of his or her election to the Board, receive an option grant to purchase a specified number of shares of our common stock and a restricted stock unit award covering an additional number of shares of our common stock, provided that such individual has not previously been in the employ of the Company or any of its parents or subsidiaries. The specific number of shares subject to the initial award, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board, but will not exceed 10,000 shares for the option component or 3,000 shares for the restricted stock unit component. In addition, on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders, each individual who will continue to serve as a non-employee director will automatically be granted an option to purchase a specified number of shares of our common stock and a restricted stock unit award covering an additional number of shares of our common stock, provided such individual has served as a non-employee director for at least six&#160;months. The specific number of shares subject to the annual award, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee, but will not exceed 3,000 shares for the option component or 750 shares for the restricted stock unit component. There will be no limit on the number of such annual awards any one eligible non-employee director may receive over his or her period of continued service on the Board, and non-employee directors who have previously been in the Company&#8217;s employ will be eligible to receive one or more such annual awards over their period of service on the Board. Each initial stock option and restricted stock unit award will vest in four equal annual installments upon the individual&#8217;s completion of each year of service. Each annual stock option and restricted stock award will vest in one installment upon the individual&#8217;s completion of one year of board service. </div>

Ozyurek, Ruffle, Stachowiak and Trotman each received an option to purchase 2,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock pursuant to the terms of the Automatic Grant Program. The exercise price of these awards was $2.68 per share for all Board members, the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the option grant date. Mr.&#160;Kelly, Dr.&#160;Larson, Ms.&#160;Lawrence and Messrs.

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July&#160;2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;), we are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our three senior executives (the &#8220;Named Executive Officers&#8221;) as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Shareholders are encouraged to read the &#8220;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8221; section of this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion of how our compensation programs further the Company&#8217;s objectives. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">At this meeting, the shareholders will be asked to vote on the following resolution: </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">&#8220;<font style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLVED</font>, that the shareholders approve the compensation paid to the Company&#8217;s Named Executive Officers as disclosed pursuant to Item&#160;402 of Regulation&#160;S-K in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and related narratives and other materials in this Proxy Statement.&#8221; </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Our Board and Compensation Committee urge shareholders to endorse the compensation program for our executive officers by voting FOR the above resolution. The Board is committed to excellence in governance and recognizes that executive compensation is an important matter for our shareholders. The Board and the Compensation Committee believe that the Company&#8217;s executive officer compensation program, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and other related sections of this proxy statement, is reasonable and effective in aligning the interests of the executive officers with both the short and long-term interests of the Company&#8217;s shareholders. We believe that our executive compensation program is designed to reward our Named Executive Officers for the achievement of short-term and long-term strategic and operational goals and the achievement of increased total shareholder value while at the same time avoiding the encouragement of unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. In particular, as described in detail in our &#8220;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#8221; below, our program has the following features. </div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-left:20pt; line-height:12pt; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; width:20pt;white-space:nowrap;">&#8226;<br ></div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">In 2016, the Compensation Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (&#8220;Meridian&#8221;) as an independent compensation consultant to advise the committee on the competitiveness of the executive compensation program. </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-left:20pt; line-height:12pt; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; width:20pt;white-space:nowrap;">&#8226;<br ></div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">In 2017, based on Meridian&#8217;s advice, the Board adopted a performance-based incentive plan that awarded restricted stock awards that vest solely on the basis of pre-determined, objective metrics over a performance period that began in 2017 and ends in 2020. </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:9.97pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">The Named Executive Officers own a significant number of shares and options to purchase shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, and the directors and officers as a group own approximately 36% of the issued and outstanding shares (not including shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock&#160;units within 60&#160;days of April&#160;5, 2019), which directly aligns their interests with that of the other shareholders. </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-left:20pt; line-height:12pt; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; width:20pt;white-space:nowrap;">&#8226;<br ></div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">None of the Named Executive Officers has an employment agreement or a severance agreement. However, the performance-based restricted stock awards granted to the Named Executive Officers in 2017 will vest on an accelerated basis in the event the officer&#8217;s employment terminates due to his death or permanent disability, or in the event of a change in control of the Company. </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. This vote is advisory, which means that it is not binding on us, our Board or the Compensation Committee of our Board. However, the Compensation Committee and our Board value the views of our shareholders and expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation decisions for our Named Executive Officers.</div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">In addition to providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, Dodd-Frank also requires that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the frequency of which we should conduct an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. By voting on this proposal, shareholders may indicate whether they would prefer an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers every year, every two&#160;years, or every three&#160;years. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Our Board and Compensation Committee continue to believe that the advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers should be conducted every year, because we believe this frequency will enable our shareholders to vote, on an advisory basis, on the most recent executive compensation information that is presented in our proxy statement, leading to more meaningful and timely communication between the Company and our shareholders on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. We believe that an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers every year will be the most effective timeframe for the Company to respond to shareholders&#8217; feedback and provide the Company with sufficient time to engage with shareholders to understand and respond to the vote results. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Shareholders are not voting to approve or disapprove the Board&#8217;s recommendation. Instead, you may cast your vote on your preferred voting frequency by choosing any of the following four options with respect to this proposal: &#8220;every year,&#8221; &#8220;every two&#160;years,&#8221; &#8220;every three&#160;years,&#8221; or &#8220;abstain.&#8221; </div>

Our Board and Compensation Committee may determine to hold votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers more or less frequently than the option approved by our shareholders (though no less frequently than once every three&#160;years). However, our Board and Compensation Committee value the views of our shareholders and expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering how frequently we submit to our shareholders a vote on the frequency of which we conduct an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. In the future, we will conduct an advisory shareholder vote on how frequently we ask shareholders to approve on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company&#8217;s Named Executive Officers at least once every six&#160;years as required by Dodd-Frank. </div>

However, we also believe that the compensation paid to our executive officers should be substantially dependent on our financial performance and the value created for our shareholders. For this reason, as we explain in more detail below, the Compensation Committee has recently instituted a performance-based incentive plan whose rewards will be based entirely on the attainment of objective goals that the Board has determined to be critical to our financial success. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">We seek to provide compensation packages for our executive officers to achieve the following objectives: </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.2pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">attract, retain, motivate and engage executives with superior leadership and management capabilities, </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">provide an overall level of compensation to each executive officer which is externally competitive, internally equitable and performance-driven, and </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-left:20pt; line-height:12pt; margin-top:6.39pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; width:20pt;white-space:nowrap;">&#8226;<br ></div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.39pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">ensure that total compensation earned by your executive officers is reflective of our financial performance and aligned with shareholders. </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; margin-top:12pt; width:436pt; line-height:11pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Elements of Compensation </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">In determining the appropriate level for each element of such compensation, the Compensation Committee subjectively reviews and evaluates the level of performance of the Company and the executive&#8217;s level of individual performance and potential to contribute to the Company&#8217;s future growth, and seeks to set compensation at a level that is both reasonable and equitable based on that assessment. We also take into account our shareholders&#8217; opinions our on our executive compensation programs when determining whether to make any changes to our programs year over year. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted an advisory vote on executive compensation at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders and will again conduct a vote in 2019. Approximately 88% of the votes cast on the advisory vote on executive compensation proposal at our 2018 annual meeting were in favor of our named executive officer compensation program as disclosed in the proxy statement. While this vote was not binding on the Company, our Board or our Compensation Committee believe that it is important for our shareholders to have an opportunity to vote on this proposal as a means to express their views regarding our executive compensation philosophy, our compensation policies and programs, and our decisions regarding executive compensation, all as disclosed in our Proxy statement. Based on the level of support at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, we determined that no changes to our compensation policies and programs were necessary in 2018. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Base Salary</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the base salary level of each executive officer. The base salary for the executive officers is determined on the basis of their level of responsibility, experience and individual performance. No base salary increases were made for executive officers in 2018. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Cash Incentive Compensation</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee believes that the significant interests which the executive officers have in our common stock provide them with a substantial incentive to contribute to our financial success and the attainment of our financial goals. Therefore, the Compensation Committee has not implemented annual cash incentive compensation programs for them. From time to time, the Compensation Committee has awarded cash bonuses and commissions in recognition of their personal performance. For fiscal 2018, no cash bonuses or commissions were awarded by the Compensation Committee to the Company&#8217;s executive officers. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Equity Compensation</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Incentive Compensation Plan provides us with flexibility in designing equity incentives and granting different types of equity awards. We believe that equity incentives are necessary for us to remain competitive in the marketplace for executive talent and other key employees. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Despite the significance equity awards play in our compensation packages, the Company is concerned about the dilutive effect of equity awards on our shareholders; accordingly, the Company is committed to using equity incentive awards prudently and within reasonable limits. As a result of our measured approach to the use of equity incentive awards, as of April&#160;5, 2019, of the 1,630,000 shares of our common stock authorized for award under our Incentive Compensation Plan, approximately 264,489 shares remained available for future award under the plan. </div>

          <font style="font-style:italic;">Executive Equity Grants.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2017, the Compensation Committee approved a new long-term incentive program as a result of the Compensation Committee&#8217;s review of our compensation practices, including a consideration of market data, the competitive nature of our program, and the form and structure for a </div>

As part of its process, the Compensation Committee approved the use of a comparator group for purposes of reviewing the competitive nature of our compensation program, and engaged an independent compensation consultant, Meridian.

        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Compensation Committee granted restricted stock awards to our executive officers effective in January&#160;2017, which will vest only upon the attainment of objective, pre-determined performance goals over the performance period beginning in 2017 and ending in 2020. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The performance-based restricted stock will vest dependent on achievement of pre-determined, objective goals relating to sales, earnings per share and market capitalization. The Compensation Committee believed that this mixture of factors would be effective because it combines the following incentives: (i)&#160;focusing our executive officers&#8217; efforts on revenue initiatives that we believe will lead to future growth of our company, (ii) relating a portion to earnings per share, which the Compensation Committee believed will be another component of future growth, and (iii) tying more directly to shareholder interests by having a portion tied to market capitalization. If any performance goal is not met by the end of March&#160;2020, the associated portion of the award will be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the performance-based restricted stock awards will vest on an accelerated basis in the event the officer&#8217;s employment terminates due to his death or permanent disability, or in the event of a change in control of the Company. The performance-based restricted stock goal related to earnings per share was attained in 2017 and Dr.&#160;Bates, Mr.&#160;Tagawa and Mr.&#160;Bates had 13,235, 11,765 and 7,353 restricted stock awards, respectively, vest, representing 20% of the total award. The remaining performance goals, which represent 80% of the award, had not yet been met as of December&#160;31, 2018. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">In connection with the compensation review conducted in 2016, the Compensation Committee determined that stock options were not as effective a tool to motivate superior performance as performance-based restricted stock tied to the achievement of metrics that the Board believed would drive growth and lead to improvements in the value of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Accordingly, no stock options were granted to the executive officers in 2018. </div>

          <font style="font-style:italic;">Timing of Equity Awards</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee does not engage in any market timing of the equity awards made to the executive officers or other award recipients. There is no established practice of timing our awards in advance of the release of favorable financial results or adjusting the award date in connection with the release of unfavorable financial developments affecting our business. All stock option grants issued under our Incentive Compensation Plan have an exercise price per share no less than the fair market value per share on the grant date. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Health and Retirement Programs</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our executive officers are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan and our flexible benefit plan on the same basis as all other regular U.S. employees. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Executive Officer Perquisites and Other Programs</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our practice to provide our executive officers with any meaningful perquisites. We have not implemented any pension arrangements, defined benefit retirement arrangements, non-qualified deferred compensation programs or any supplemental executive retirement plans for our executive officers. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Employment Agreements</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the executive officers has an employment or severance agreement. However, the performance-based restricted stock awards granted in 2017 will vest on an accelerated basis in the event the officer&#8217;s employment terminates due to his death or permanent disability, or in the event of a change in control of the Company.</div>

      <div style="margin-top:46pt;height:660pt;margin-left:70pt;width:456pt;">
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; width:436pt; line-height:11pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Compensation Committee Processes </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; margin-top:3pt; width:436pt; line-height:11pt;font-style:italic;">Role of Compensation Consultant </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to retain the services of one or more external advisors, including compensation consultants, legal counsel, accounting, and other advisors, to assist it in performance of its duties and responsibilities. The Compensation Committee makes all determinations regarding the engagement, fees, and services of these external advisors, and any such external advisor reports directly to the Compensation Committee. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">During 2016, the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian to assist it in connection with its review, analysis, and determinations with respect to the compensation of our executive officers. As part of its engagement, Meridian also assisted the Compensation Committee with the identification of a comparator group, and using this comparator group provided competitive market data and analysis relating to the compensation of our executive officers. Because the incentive plan designed with the assistance of Meridian covers the period from 2017 to 2020, and because there was no other adjustment to executive compensation in 2018, the Compensation Committee did not use Meridian or any other compensation consultant during 2018. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Compensation Committee may replace its compensation consultant or hire additional advisors at any time. All decisions regarding the compensation of our executive officers, however, are made by the Compensation Committee. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; margin-top:12pt; width:436pt; line-height:11pt;font-style:italic;">Use of Competitive Compensation Data </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">We do not believe that it is appropriate to make compensation decisions, whether regarding base salaries or annual or long-term incentive compensation, upon any type of benchmarking to a peer or other representative group of companies. Instead, the Compensation Committee believes that information regarding the compensation practices at other companies are useful as a reference point for its compensation decisions. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Tax Considerations</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&#160;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain of their executive officers to the extent such compensation exceeds $1.0&#160;million per covered officer in any year. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;TCJA&#8221;), this limitation applied only to compensation that is not considered to be performance-based under the terms of Code Section&#160;162(m), and our Incentive Compensation Plan was structured with the objective of providing the Company with the opportunity to qualify one or more awards under the plan (including the performance-based restricted stock awards granted in 2017) as performance-based compensation for purposes of Code Section&#160;162(m). The TCJA provides transition relief for certain contractual arrangements in place as of November&#160;2, 2017. Regardless, we believe that in establishing the cash and equity incentive compensation programs for our executive officers, the potential deductibility of the compensation payable under those programs should be only one of a number of relevant factors taken into consideration, and not the sole governing factor. For that reason, we may deem it appropriate to provide one or more executive officers with the opportunity to earn incentive compensation that is not deductible. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">In addition to our advisory vote on executive compensation, we are committed to ongoing engagement with our shareholders on executive compensation and corporate governance issues.</div>

No other individuals who would have been includable in such table on the basis of total compensation for fiscal 2018 but for the fact that they were no longer serving as executive officers at the end of fiscal 2018 are required to be included.

        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Introduction </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Our shareholders are being asked to vote on a proposal to approve the amendment and restatement of our Incentive Compensation Plan (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) in order to extend the term of the Plan by two&#160;years. Our Board adopted the amended and restated Plan on April&#160;24, 2019 subject to shareholder approval at the Meeting. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Purpose of the Amendment and Restatement of the Plan </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;">Extension of the Term of the Plan</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity incentive awards play a significant role in the compensation provided to the Company&#8217;s executive officers and employees. The Company relies on equity compensation in order to attract and retain key employees, align the interests of the Company&#8217;s executive officers with those of our shareholders, and to provide the Company&#8217;s executive officers and other employees with the opportunity to accumulate retirement income. Despite the significance equity awards play in our compensation packages, the Company is concerned about the dilutive effect of equity awards on our shareholders; accordingly, the Company is committed to using equity incentive awards prudently and within reasonable limits. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">As a result of our measured approach to the use of equity incentive awards, as of April&#160;5, 2019, of the 1,630,000 shares of our common stock authorized for award under the Plan, approximately 264,489 shares remained available for future award under the Plan. Because we believe that the current available Plan reserve provides the Company with a sufficient number of shares to fund the Company&#8217;s equity compensation needs over the next two&#160;years, we are seeking to extend the expiration date of the Plan by two&#160;years, from February&#160;22, 2020 to February&#160;22, 2022. Shareholders are not being asked to approve an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan. </div>
        <div style="margin-top:12pt; width:456pt; line-height:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Summary Description of the Amended and Restated Plan </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The principal terms and provisions of the Plan are summarized below. The summary, however, is not intended to be a complete description of all the terms of the Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Plan, which is attached hereto as Appendix&#160;A. Any shareholder who wishes to obtain a copy of the actual Plan document may do so upon written request to our Corporate Secretary at our principal offices at Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 410, San Francisco, CA 94111. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Incentive Programs.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan consists of four separate equity incentive programs: (i)&#160;the discretionary grant program, (ii) the stock issuance program, (iii) the incentive bonus program, and (iv) the automatic grant program for the non-employee members of our Board of Directors. The principal features of each program are described below. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Types of Awards.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various types of equity incentives which may be issued under the Plan (collectively, the &#8220;Awards&#8221;) are as follows: (i)&#160;stock options and stock appreciation rights under the discretionary grant program, (ii) stock bonuses and stock issuances pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock&#160;units, performance shares and other stock-base awards under the stock issuance program, (iii) cash bonus awards, performance unit awards and dividend equivalent rights under the incentive bonus program (iv) and stock options and restricted stock unit awards to our non-employee Board members under the automatic grant program. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Administration.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation committee of our Board of Directors will have the exclusive authority to administer the discretionary grant, incentive bonus and stock issuance programs with respect to Awards made to our executive officers and Board members and will also have the authority to make Awards under those programs to all other eligible individuals. However, our Board of Directors may at any time appoint a secondary committee of one or more Board members to have separate but concurrent authority with the compensation committee to make Awards under those programs to individuals other than executive officers and Board members. </div>

      <div style="padding:0pt;margin:0pt;font-family:calibri, arial, sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:8pt;line-height:8pt;">&#8203;</div>
      <div style="margin-top:46pt;margin-left:70pt;width:456pt;">
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The term &#8220;plan administrator,&#8221; as used in this summary, will mean our compensation committee and any secondary committee, to the extent each such entity is acting within the scope of its administrative authority under the Plan. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The compensation committee will have limited discretion under the automatic grant program to determine the number of shares subject to each option grant and restricted stock unit award made under that program, if any, up to the maximum number of shares permissible per grant or award, but all option grants and restricted stock unit awards will otherwise be made in strict compliance with the express terms of that program. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Eligibility.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers and employees, as well as independent consultants and contractors, in our employ or in the employ of our parent or subsidiary companies (whether now existing or subsequently established) will be eligible to participate in the discretionary grant, incentive bonus and stock issuance programs. The non-employee members of our Board of Directors will also be eligible to participate in those programs as well as the automatic grant program. As of April&#160;5, 2019, approximately 10 persons (including 3 executive officers) were eligible to participate in the discretionary grant, incentive bonus and stock issuance programs, and 7 non-employee Board members were eligible to participate in those programs and the automatic grant program. Because our executives and non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the Plan, they may be deemed to have a personal interest in the approval of this Proposal 4. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Securities Subject to Plan.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,630,000 shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance over the term of the Plan. The shares of common stock issuable under the Plan may be drawn from shares of our authorized but unissued common stock or from shares of our common stock that the Company acquires, including shares purchased on the open market or in private transactions. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">As of April&#160;5, 2019, 613,000 shares in the aggregate were subject to outstanding options under the Plan, 166,069 shares were subject to unvested restricted stock&#160;units under the Plan, 310,739 shares had been issued under the Plan, and, after taking into account the impact of the Share Counting Provisions described below, 264,489 shares remained available for future award under the Plan. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Share Counting Provisions.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of shares of common stock reserved for award and issuance under the Plan will be reduced: (i)&#160;on a one-for-one basis for each share of common stock subject to an Award made under the discretionary grant program or subject to a stock option grant made under the automatic grant program, (ii) on a one-for-one basis for each share of common stock issued pursuant to a Full Value Award made under the stock issuance, incentive bonus and automatic grant programs prior to March&#160;18, 2010 and (iii) by a fixed ratio of 1.59 shares of common stock for each share of common stock issued pursuant to a Full Value Award made under the stock issuance, incentive bonus and automatic grant programs on or after March&#160;18, 2010. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">For such purpose, a Full Value Award will be any of the following Awards made under the stock issuance, incentive bonus or automatic grant programs of the Plan that are settled in shares of our common stock: restricted stock awards (unless issued for cash consideration equal to the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the award date), restricted stock&#160;units, performance shares, performance&#160;units, and any other share-settled awards under the Plan other than (i)&#160;stock options and stock appreciation rights issued under the discretionary grant program, (ii) stock options issued under the automatic grant program and (iii) dividend equivalent rights under the incentive bonus program. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Shares of common stock subject to outstanding Awards made under the Plan (including the options transferred from the predecessor plans) will be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan to the extent those awards expire or terminate for any reason prior to the issuance of the shares of common stock subject to those awards. Such shares will be added back to the number of shares of common stock reserved for award and issuance under the Plan as follows: </div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-left:20pt; line-height:12pt; margin-top:3.02pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:justify; width:20pt;white-space:nowrap;">&#8226;<br ></div>
        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:3.02pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">For each share of common stock subject to such an expired, forfeited, cancelled or terminated award made under the discretionary grant program (including the options transferred from the predecessor plans) or subject to an option grant made under the automatic grant program, one share of common stock will become available for subsequent award and issuance under the Plan. </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:3.01pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">For each share of common stock subject to a forfeited or cancelled Full Value Award made under the stock issuance, automatic grant or incentive bonus program prior to March&#160;18, 2010, one share will become available for subsequent award and issuance. </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">For each unvested share of common stock issued under the discretionary grant or stock issuance program for cash consideration not less than the fair market value per share of common stock on the award date and subsequently repurchased by us, at a price per share not greater than the original issue price paid per share, pursuant to our repurchase rights under the Plan, one share will become available for subsequent award and issuance under the Plan. </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.59pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">There are no net counting provisions in effect under the Plan.

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">Should the exercise price of an option be paid in shares of our common stock, then the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan will be reduced by the gross number of shares for which that option is exercised, and not by the net number of new shares issued under the exercised option. </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">Should shares of common stock otherwise issuable under the Plan be withheld by us in satisfaction of the withholding taxes incurred in connection with the exercise, issuance or vesting of an Award, then the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Plan will be reduced on the basis of the full number of shares that were issuable under the Award, and not on the basis of the net number of shares actually issued after any such share withholding. </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:6.8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">For awards denominated in shares of our common stock at the time of grant (whether payable in common stock, cash or a combination of both), a participant in the Plan may not receive awards for more than 150,000 shares of our common stock in the aggregate. However, for the calendar year in which such person first commences service, the foregoing limitation will be increased to 200,000 shares. Such share limitations will be subject to adjustment from time to time for stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions affecting the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. </div>

          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Discretionary Grant Program.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the discretionary grant program, eligible persons may be granted options to purchase shares of our common stock or stock appreciation rights tied to the value of our common stock. The plan administrator will have complete discretion to determine which eligible individuals are to receive such Awards, the time or times when those Awards are to be made, the number of shares subject to each such Award, the vesting schedule (if any) to be in effect for the Award, the maximum term for which the Award is to remain outstanding and the status of any granted option as either an incentive stock option or a non-statutory option under the federal tax laws. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Each granted option will have an exercise price per share determined by the plan administrator, but the exercise price will not be less than one hundred&#160;percent of the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date. No granted option will have a term in excess of seven&#160;years. The shares subject to each option will generally vest in one or more installments over a specified period of service measured from the grant date. However, one or more options may be structured so that they will be immediately exercisable for any or all of the option shares. The shares acquired under such immediately exercisable options will be subject to repurchase by us, at the lower of the exercise price paid per share or the fair market value per share, if the optionee ceases service prior to vesting in those shares. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Upon cessation of service, the optionee will have a limited period of time in which to exercise his or her outstanding options to the extent exercisable for vested shares. The plan administrator will have complete discretion to extend the period following the optionee&#8217;s cessation of service during which his or her outstanding options may be exercised and/or to accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such options in whole or in part. Such discretion may be exercised at any time while the options remain outstanding, whether before or after the optionee&#8217;s actual cessation of service. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Plan will allow the issuance of two types of stock appreciation rights under the discretionary grant program: </div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">Tandem stock appreciation rights provide the holders with the right to surrender their options for an appreciation distribution from us in an amount equal to the excess of&#8201; (i)&#160;the fair market value of the vested shares of our common stock subject to the surrendered option over (ii) the aggregate exercise price payable for those shares. </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>

        <div style=" float:left; margin-top:9.98pt; margin-bottom:0pt; line-height:12pt; text-align:justify; width:415.5pt;">Stand-alone stock appreciation rights allow the holders to exercise those rights as to a specific number of shares of our common stock and receive in exchange an appreciation distribution from us in an amount equal to the excess of&#8201; (i)&#160;the fair market value of the shares of common stock as to which those rights are exercised over (ii) the aggregate base price in effect for those shares. The base price per share may not be less than the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date the stand-alone stock appreciation right is granted, and the right may not have a term in excess of seven&#160;years. </div>
        <div style="clear:both; padding:0pt; margin:0pt;font-size:0pt;line-height:0pt;">&#8203;</div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The distribution with respect to any exercised tandem or stand-alone stock appreciation right will be made in shares of our common stock. Stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for a limited period following the holder&#8217;s cessation of service, but only to the extent those rights are exercisable at the time of such cessation of service. The plan administrator will have complete discretion to extend the period following the holder&#8217;s cessation of service during which his or her outstanding stock appreciation rights may be exercised and/or to accelerate the exercisability or vesting of those stock appreciation rights in whole or in part. Such discretion may be exercised at any time while the stock appreciation right remains outstanding, whether before or after the holder&#8217;s actual cessation of service.</div>

The holder of a stock appreciation right will not have any shareholder rights with respect to the shares subject to that right unless and until such person exercises the right and becomes the holder of record of any shares of our common stock distributed upon such exercise. Options are not assignable or transferable other than by will or the laws of inheritance following optionee&#8217;s death, and during the optionee&#8217;s lifetime, the option may only be exercised by the optionee. However, the plan administrator may structure one or more non-statutory options under the Plan so that those options will be transferable during optionee&#8217;s lifetime to one or more members of the optionee&#8217;s family or to a trust established for the optionee and/or one or more such family members or to the optionee&#8217;s former spouse, to the extent such transfer is in connection with the optionee&#8217;s estate plan or pursuant to a domestic relations order.

Accordingly, the participant will have the right to vote such shares and to receive any regular cash dividends paid on such shares, but will not have the right to transfer such shares prior to vesting. A participant will not have any shareholder rights with respect to the shares of common stock subject to a restricted stock unit or other share right award until that unit or award vests and the shares of common stock are actually issued thereunder. However, dividend-equivalent&#160;units may be paid or credited, either in cash or in actual or phantom shares of common stock, on outstanding restricted stock&#160;units or other share-right awards, subject to such terms and conditions as the plan administrator may deem appropriate. In no event, however, will any dividends or dividend-equivalent&#160;units relating to awards subject to performance-vesting conditions vest or otherwise become payable prior to the time the underlying award vests and will accordingly be subject to cancellation and forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying award in the event those performance conditions are not attained. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:11.5pt;">The following is a summary of the Federal income taxation treatment applicable to us and the participants who receive awards under the Plan. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Option Grants.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options granted under the discretionary grant program may be either incentive stock options which satisfy the requirements of Section&#160;422 of the Internal Revenue Code or non-statutory options which are not intended to meet such requirements. The Federal income tax treatment for the two&#160;types of options differs as follows: </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Incentive Options.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No taxable income is recognized by the optionee at the time of the option grant, and no taxable income is recognized for regular tax purposes at the time the option is exercised, although taxable income may arise at that time for alternative minimum tax purposes. The optionee will recognize taxable income in the year in which the purchased shares are sold or otherwise made the subject of certain other dispositions. For Federal tax purposes, dispositions are divided into two categories: (i)&#160;qualifying, and (ii) disqualifying. A qualifying disposition occurs if the sale or other disposition is made more than two (2)&#160;years after the date the option for the shares involved in such sale or disposition is granted and more than one (1)&#160;year after the date the option is exercised for those shares. If the sale or disposition occurs before these two periods are satisfied, then a disqualifying disposition will result. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Upon a qualifying disposition, the optionee will recognize long-term capital gain in an amount equal to the excess of&#8201; (i)&#160;the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition of the purchased shares over (ii)&#160;the exercise price paid for the shares. If there is a disqualifying disposition of the shares, then the excess of&#8201; (i)&#160;the fair market value of those shares on the exercise date or (if less) the amount realized upon such sale or disposition over (ii) the exercise price paid for the shares will be taxable as ordinary income to the optionee. Any additional gain recognized upon the disposition will be a capital gain. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">If the optionee makes a disqualifying disposition of the purchased shares, then we will be entitled to an income tax deduction, for the taxable year in which such disposition occurs, equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee as a result of the disposition. We will not be entitled to any income tax deduction if the optionee makes a qualifying disposition of the shares. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Non-Statutory Options.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No taxable income is recognized by an optionee upon the grant of a non-statutory option. The optionee will in general recognize ordinary income, in the year in which the option is exercised, equal to the excess of the fair market value of the purchased shares on the exercise date over the exercise price paid for the shares, and the optionee will be required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee with respect to the exercised non-statutory option. The deduction will in general be allowed for our taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized by the optionee. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Stock Appreciation Rights.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of a stock appreciation right. The holder will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the stock appreciation right is exercised, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the exercise date over the exercise price, and the holder will be required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder in connection with the exercise of the stock appreciation right. The deduction will be allowed for our taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">
          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Restricted Stock Awards.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipient of unvested shares of common stock issued under the Plan will not recognize any taxable income at the time those shares are issued but will have to report as ordinary income, as and when those shares subsequently vest, an amount equal to the excess of&#8201; (i)&#160;the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date over (ii) the cash consideration (if any) paid for the shares. The recipient may, however, elect under Section&#160;83(b) of the Code to include as ordinary income in the year the unvested shares are issued an amount equal to the excess of&#8201; (i)&#160;the fair market value of those shares on the issue date over (ii) the cash consideration (if any) paid for such shares. If the Section&#160;83(b) election is made, the recipient will not recognize any additional income as and when the shares subsequently vest. We will be </div>

          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Restricted Stock Units.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of restricted stock&#160;units. The holder will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the shares subject to the&#160;units are actually issued to the holder. The amount of that income will be equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance, and the holder will be required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder at the time the shares are issued.

The recipient will be required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder at the time the cash award is paid. The deduction will be allowed for our taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized. </div>

The holder will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the performance&#160;units are settled. The amount of that income will be equal to the fair market value of the shares of common stock or cash received in settlement of the performance&#160;units, and the holder will be required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of the ordinary income recognized by the holder of the performance&#160;units at the time those&#160;units are settled. That deduction will be allowed for the taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized. </div>

          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Dividend Equivalent Rights.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of a dividend equivalent right award. The holder will recognize ordinary income in the year in which a payment pursuant to such right, whether in cash, securities or other property, is made to the holder. The amount of that income will be equal to the fair market value of the cash, securities or other property received, and the holder will be required to satisfy the tax withholding requirements applicable to such income. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of the ordinary income recognized by the holder of the dividend equivalent right award at the time the dividend or distribution is paid to such holder. That deduction will be allowed for our taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized. </div>

          <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Deductibility of Executive Compensation.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&#160;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain of their executive officers to the extent such compensation exceeds $1.0&#160;million per covered officer in any year. Prior to the enactment of the TCJA, this limitation applied only to compensation that is not considered to be performance-based under the terms of Code Section&#160;162(m). However, the TJCA eliminated the performance-based compensation exception for awards granted on or after January&#160;1, 2018. The exception may be preserved for awards granted prior to January&#160;1, 2018, to the extent the awards are not materially modified after November&#160;2, 2017. We anticipate, but cannot guarantee, that any compensation deemed paid by us in connection with the exercise of non-statutory options or the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock option shares, in either case granted prior to January&#160;1, 2018, and the vesting of the performance-based restricted stock awards granted in January&#160;2017, will qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section&#160;162(m) and will not have to be taken into account for purposes of the $1&#160;million limitation per covered individual on the deductibility of the compensation paid to certain of our executive officers; provided that the awards are not materially modified after November&#160;2, 2017. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm in order to assure that the provision of such services and related fees do not impair the independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s independence. The independent registered public accounting firm must provide the Audit Committee with an engagement letter outlining the scope of the audit services proposed to be performed during the applicable calendar year and the proposed fees for such audit services. If agreed to by the Audit Committee, the engagement letter will be formally accepted by the Audit Committee as evidenced by the execution of the engagement letter by the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee approves, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Company structure or other matters. The Audit Committee may grant pre-approval for those permissible non-audit services that it believes are services that would not impair the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee may not grant approval for any services categorized as &#8220;Prohibited Non-Audit Services&#8221; by the SEC. Certain non-audit services have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee, and all other non-audit services must be separately approved by the Audit Committee. </div>

        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The following Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates the Report by reference therein. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Audit Committee of the Board consists of five directors, all of whom are &#8216;independent&#8217; as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE American. The primary purposes of the Audit Committee are to review the financial reporting and internal controls of the Company, to appoint an independent registered public accounting firm, to review the reports of such auditors, and to review annually the Audit Committee charter. During 2018, the Audit Committee held five meetings. Mr.&#160;Ruffle is Chair of the Audit Committee. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Audit Committee reviewed and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2018. The topics of these discussions included the quality of the Company&#8217;s internal controls, the audit plans, audit scope and identification of audit risks. In addition, the Committee received assurances that the independent registered public accounting firm reviewed and discussed with management the interim financial reports prior to each quarterly earnings announcement. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm provided a formal written statement that described all relationships between the auditors and the Company with respect to the auditors&#8217; independence within the meaning of the federal securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Audit Committee satisfied itself as to the public accounting firm&#8217;s independence. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm all matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16 or any successor standard, as amended, &#8220;Communications with Audit Committees&#8221; and, with and without the presence of management, reviewed and discussed the results of the independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s examination of the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Management, being responsible for the Company&#8217;s financial statements, represented that the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for the examination of those statements. </div>
        <div style="text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:456pt; line-height:12pt;">Based on the Audit Committee&#8217;s discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and the Audit Committee&#8217;s review as described previously, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company&#8217;s audited financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&#160;31, 2018, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </div>

        <div style="margin-left:40pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:416pt; line-height:12pt;">&#8201;&#8212;&#8201; the Incentive Bonus Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan&#160;Administrator, be provided with incentive bonus opportunities through performance unit awards and special cash incentive programs tied to the attainment of pre-established performance milestones, and </div>

Administration of the Discretionary Grant, Stock Issuance and Incentive Bonus Programs with respect to all other persons eligible to participate in those programs may, at the Board&#8217;s discretion, be vested in the Compensation Committee or a Secondary Board Committee, or the Board may retain the power to administer those programs with respect to all such persons. However, any Awards made to the members of the Compensation Committee other than pursuant to the Automatic Grant Program must be authorized by a disinterested majority of the Board. </div>

One or more Optionees may be granted a Tandem Right, exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Plan&#160;Administrator may establish, to elect between the exercise of the underlying option for shares of Common Stock or the surrender of that option in exchange for a distribution from the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of&#8201; (i)&#160;the Fair Market Value (on the option surrender date) of the number of shares in which the Optionee is at the time vested under the surrendered option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (ii) the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested shares. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:40pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:416pt; line-height:12pt;">2. No such option surrender shall be effective unless it is approved by the Plan&#160;Administrator, either at the time of the actual option surrender or at any earlier time. If the surrender is so approved, then the distribution to which the Optionee shall accordingly become entitled under this Section&#160;III shall be made in shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value on the option surrender date. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:40pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:416pt; line-height:12pt;">3.

One or more individuals eligible to participate in the Discretionary Grant Program may be granted a Stand-alone Right not tied to any underlying option under this Discretionary Grant Program. The Stand-alone Right shall relate to a specified number of shares of Common Stock and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Plan&#160;Administrator may establish. In no event, however, may the Stand-alone Right have a maximum term in excess of seven (7)&#160;years measured from the grant date. Upon exercise of the Stand-alone Right, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of (i)&#160;the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the exercise date) of the shares of Common Stock underlying the exercised right over (ii) the aggregate base price in effect for those shares. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:40pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:416pt; line-height:12pt;">2. The number of shares of Common Stock underlying each Stand-alone Right and the base price in effect for those shares shall be determined by the Plan&#160;Administrator in its sole discretion at the time the Stand-alone Right is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per share be less than the Fair Market Value per underlying share of Common Stock on the grant date. In the event outstanding Stand-alone Rights are to be assumed in connection with a Change in Control transaction or otherwise continued in effect, the shares of Common Stock underlying each such Stand-alone Right shall be adjusted immediately after such Change in Control so as to apply to the number and class of securities into which those shares of Common Stock would have been converted in consummation of such Change in Control had those shares actually been outstanding at that time. Appropriate adjustments to reflect such Change in Control shall also be made to the base price per share in effect under each outstanding Stand-alone Right, <font style=" text-decoration:underline;">provided</font> the aggregate base price shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation&#8217;s outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding Stand-alone Rights under the Discretionary Grant Program, substitute, for the securities underlying those assumed rights, one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in the Change in Control transaction. </div>

However, an outstanding Award under the Discretionary Grant Program shall <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">not</font> become exercisable on such an accelerated basis if and to the extent: (i)&#160;such Award is to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or is otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) such Award is to be replaced with a cash retention program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing at the time of the Change in Control on any shares as to which the Award is not otherwise at that time vested and exercisable and provides for the subsequent vesting and concurrent payout of that spread in accordance with the same exercise/vesting schedule in effect for that Award, but only if such replacement cash program would not result in the treatment of the Award as an item of deferred compensation subject to Code Section&#160;409A or (iii) the acceleration of such Award is subject to other limitations imposed by the Plan&#160;Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Award outstanding under the Discretionary Grant Program on the date of such Change in Control shall be subject to cancellation and termination, without cash payment or other consideration due the Award holder, if the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of such Change in Control (or any earlier date specified in the definitive agreement for the Change in Control transaction) is less than the per share exercise or base price in effect for such Award. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">B. All outstanding repurchase rights under the Discretionary Grant Program shall automatically terminate, and the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights shall immediately vest in full, in the event of a Change in Control, except to the extent: (i)&#160;those repurchase rights are to be assigned to the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or are otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) such accelerated vesting is precluded by other limitations imposed by the Plan&#160;Administrator. </div>

Appropriate adjustments to reflect such Change in Control shall also be made to the exercise price payable per share under each outstanding option, <font style=" text-decoration:underline;">provided</font> the aggregate exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation&#8217;s outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding options under the Discretionary Grant Program, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction. </div>

In addition, the Plan&#160;Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more of the Corporation&#8217;s repurchase rights under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those rights shall immediately terminate upon the consummation of the Change in Control transaction, and the shares subject to those terminated rights shall thereupon vest in full. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">F. The Plan&#160;Administrator shall have full power and authority to structure one or more outstanding Awards under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those Awards shall become exercisable as to all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to those Awards in the event the Optionee&#8217;s Service is subsequently terminated by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of any Change in Control transaction in which those Awards do not otherwise fully accelerate. In addition, the Plan&#160;Administrator may structure one or more of the Corporation&#8217;s repurchase rights so that those rights shall immediately terminate with respect to any shares held by the Optionee at the time of such Involuntary Termination, and the shares subject to those terminated repurchase rights shall accordingly vest in full at that time. </div>

The Plan&#160;Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority, consistent with Code Section&#160;162(m), to structure one or more Awards under the Stock Issuance Program so that the shares of Common Stock subject to those Awards shall vest (or vest and become issuable) upon the achievement of certain pre-established corporate performance objectives based on one or more Performance Goals and measured over the performance period (not to exceed five (5)&#160;years) specified by the Plan&#160;Administrator at the time of the Award. </div>

The Participant shall have full shareholder rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant under the Stock Issuance Program, whether or not the Participant&#8217;s interest in those shares is vested. Accordingly, the Participant shall have the right to vote such shares and to receive any dividends paid on such shares, subject to any applicable vesting requirements, including (without limitation) the requirement that any dividends paid on shares subject to performance-vesting conditions shall be held in escrow by the Corporation and shall not vest or actually be paid to the Award holder prior to the time those shares vest. The Participant shall not have any shareholder rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to a restricted stock unit or share right award until that award vests and the shares of Common Stock are actually issued thereunder. However, dividend-equivalent&#160;units may be paid or credited, either in cash or in actual or phantom shares of Common Stock, on outstanding Awards of performance share or restricted stock&#160;units, subject to such terms and conditions as the Plan&#160;Administrator may deem appropriate. In no event, however, shall dividends or dividend-equivalent&#160;units relating to Awards subject to performance-vesting conditions vest or otherwise become payable prior to the time the underlying Award (or portion thereof to which such dividends or dividend-equivalents&#160;units relate) vests upon the attainment of the applicable performance goals and shall accordingly be subject to cancellation and forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying Award in the event those performance conditions are not attained. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:40pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:416pt; line-height:12pt;">5. Should the Participant cease to remain in Service while holding one or more unvested shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program or should the performance objectives not be attained with respect to one or more such unvested shares of Common Stock, then those shares shall be immediately surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation, and the Participant shall have no further shareholder rights with respect to those shares. To the extent the surrendered shares were previously issued to the Participant for consideration paid in cash or cash equivalent, the Corporation shall repay to the Participant the <font style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">lower </font>of&#8201; (i)&#160;the cash consideration paid for the surrendered shares or (ii) the Fair Market Value of those shares at the time of cancellation. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:40pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:416pt; line-height:12pt;">6. The Plan&#160;Administrator may in its discretion waive the surrender and cancellation of one or more unvested shares of Common Stock which would otherwise occur upon the cessation of the Participant&#8217;s Service or the non-attainment of the performance objectives applicable to those shares. Any such waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the Participant&#8217;s interest in the shares of Common Stock as to which the waiver applies. Such waiver may be effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant&#8217;s cessation of Service or the attainment or non-attainment of the applicable performance objectives. However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of Performance Goals may be waived with respect to Awards which were intended at the time of grant to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section&#160;162(m), except in the event of the Participant&#8217;s cessation of Service by reason of death or Permanent Disability or as otherwise provided in Section&#160;II of this Article&#160;Three. </div>

The Plan&#160;Administrator, however, shall have the discretionary authority to issue vested shares of Common Stock under one or more outstanding Awards of restricted stock&#160;units or performance shares as to which the designated performance goals or Service requirements have not been attained or satisfied. However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of Performance Goals may be waived with respect to Awards which were intended, at the time those Awards were made, to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section&#160;162(m), except in the event of the Participant&#8217;s cessation of Service by reason of death or Permanent Disability or as otherwise provided in Section&#160;II of this Article&#160;Three.</div>

        <div style="margin-left:60pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:396pt; line-height:12pt;">(ii) The performance shares which so vest shall be paid as soon as practicable following the end of the performance period, unless such payment is to be deferred for the period specified by the Plan&#160;Administrator at the time the performance shares are awarded or the period selected by the Participant in accordance with the applicable requirements of Code Section&#160;409A. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:60pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:396pt; line-height:12pt;">(iii) Performance shares may be paid in (i)&#160;cash, (ii) shares of Common Stock or (iii) any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. </div>

        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">A. Each Award outstanding under the Stock Issuance Program on the effective date of an actual Change in Control transaction may be (i)&#160;assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the Fair Market Value of the underlying shares of Common Stock at the time of the Change in Control and provides for the subsequent vesting and payment of that value in accordance with the same vesting schedule in effect for those shares at the time of such Change in Control. If any such Award is subject to a performance-vesting condition tied to the attainment of one or more specified performance goals, then upon the assumption, continuation or replacement of that Award, the performance vesting condition shall automatically be cancelled, and such Award shall thereupon be converted into a Service-vesting Award that will vest upon the completion of a Service period co-terminous with the portion of the performance period (and any subsequent Service vesting component that was originally part of that Award) remaining at the time of the Change in Control. However, to the extent any Award outstanding under the Stock Issuance Program on the effective date of such Change in Control Transaction is not to be so assumed, continued or replaced, that Award shall vest in full immediately prior to the effective date of the actual Change in Control transaction and the shares of Common Stock underlying the portion of the Award that vests on such accelerated basis shall be issued in accordance with the applicable Award Agreement, unless such accelerated vesting is precluded by other limitations imposed in the Stock Issuance Agreement. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">B.

The Plan&#160;Administrator may in its discretion waive the cancellation and termination of one or more unvested Cash Awards which would otherwise occur upon the cessation of the Participant&#8217;s Service or the non-attainment of the performance objectives applicable to those Awards. Any such waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the Participant&#8217;s interest in the Cash Award as to which the waiver applies.

In no event, however, shall any DER Award made with respect to an Award subject to performance-vesting conditions under the Stock Issuance or Incentive Bonus Program vest or become payable prior to the vesting of that Award (or the portion thereof to which the DER Award relates) upon the attainment of the applicable performance goals and shall accordingly be subject to cancellation and forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying Award in the event those performance conditions are not attained. </div>

Immediately following the consummation of the Change in Control, each automatic option grant shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction. </div>

Each option which is assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to the Optionee in consummation of such Change in Control had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Change in Control. Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the exercise price payable per share under each outstanding option, <font style=" text-decoration:underline;">provided</font> the aggregate exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation&#8217;s outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding options under the Automatic Grant Program, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction. </div>

Any such alternative award shall be made at the same time the automatic option grant or restricted stock unit award which it replaces would have been made, and the vesting provisions (including vesting acceleration) applicable to such award shall be substantially the same as in effect for the automatic option grant or restricted stock unit award so replaced. </div>

        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">Unvested shares may, in the Plan&#160;Administrator&#8217;s discretion, be held in escrow by the Corporation until the Participant&#8217;s interest in such shares vests or may be issued directly to the Participant with restrictive legends on the certificates evidencing those unvested shares. </div>

        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">A. The Board shall have complete and exclusive power and authority to amend or modify the Plan in any or all respects. However, no such amendment or modification shall adversely affect the rights and obligations with respect to Awards at the time outstanding under the Plan unless the Optionee or the Participant consents to such amendment or modification. In addition, amendments to the Plan will be subject to shareholder approval to the extent required under applicable law or regulation or pursuant to the listing standards of the Stock Exchange on which the Common Stock is at the time primarily traded, and no amendment that would reduce or limit the scope of the prohibition on repricing programs set forth in Section&#160;VI of Article&#160;One or otherwise eliminated such prohibition shall be effective unless approved by the shareholders. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">B. The Compensation Committee of the Board shall have the discretionary authority to adopt and implement from time to time such addenda or subplans to the Plan as it may deem necessary in order to bring the Plan into compliance with applicable laws and regulations of any foreign jurisdictions in which grants or awards are to be made under the Plan and/or to obtain favorable tax treatment in those foreign jurisdictions for the individuals to whom the grants or awards are made. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">C. Awards may be made under the Plan that involve shares of Common Stock in excess of the number of shares then available for issuance under the Plan, provided no shares shall actually be issued pursuant to those Awards until the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan is sufficiently increased by shareholder approval of an amendment of the Plan authorizing such increase. If shareholder approval is required and is not obtained within twelve (12) months after the date the first excess Award is made, then all Awards granted on the basis of such excess shares shall terminate and cease to be outstanding. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">D. The provisions of the Plan and the outstanding Awards under the Plan shall, in the event of any ambiguity, be construed, applied and interpreted in a manner so as to ensure that all Awards and Award Agreements provided to Optionees or Participants who are subject to U.S. income taxation either qualify for an exemption from the requirements of Section&#160;409A of the Code or comply with those requirements; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not make any representations that any Awards made under the Plan will in fact be exempt from the requirements of Section&#160;409A of the Code or otherwise comply with those requirements, and each Optionee and Participant shall accordingly be solely responsible for any taxes, penalties or other amounts which may become payable with respect to his or her Awards by reason of Section&#160;409A of the Code. </div>

        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">A. The implementation of the Plan, the grant of any Award and the issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection with the issuance, exercise or vesting of any Award made under the Plan shall be subject to the Corporation&#8217;s procurement of all approvals and permits required by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Plan, the Awards made under the Plan and the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to those Awards. </div>
        <div style="margin-left:20pt; text-indent:20pt; margin-top:6pt; text-align:justify; width:436pt; line-height:12pt;">B. No shares of Common Stock or other assets shall be issued or delivered under the Plan unless and until there shall have been compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable securities laws, including the filing and effectiveness of the Form S-8 registration statement for the shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan, and all applicable listing requirements of any Stock Exchange on which Common Stock is then listed for trading.</div>
