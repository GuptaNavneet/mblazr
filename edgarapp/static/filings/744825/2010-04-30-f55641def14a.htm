    Beginning with the 2010 proxy season, the New York Stock
    Exchange has changed its rules to make the election of directors
    in an uncontested election a non-routine item. This means that
    brokers who do not receive voting instructions from their
    clients as to how to vote their shares for the election of
    directors cannot exercise discretion to vote for directors. Due
    to this rule change, at this year&#146;s annual meeting, the
    election of directors will be a non-routine item. Therefore, it
    is important that you instruct your broker as to how you wish to
    have your shares voted on these proposals, even if you wish to
    vote as recommended by the Board of Directors.

    For many years our founder, Ernest A. Bates,&#160;M.D., has
    served as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the
    Company. The Board believes that Dr.&#160;Bates&#146; intimate
    knowledge of the Company&#146;s business and customers, and his
    significant ownership of our common stock, closely align him
    with the interests of all of our constituencies and position him
    well to lead the Board, which in turn determines the
    Company&#146;s overall direction. Since each of the
    Company&#146;s committees, through which the Board oversees
    management and reviews risk, is comprised only of independent
    directors, the Board has not considered it necessary to appoint
    a Lead Director. In addition, the small size of the Board makes
    communications among Directors and with management swift and
    simple and the independent directors see no benefit to adding
    one more layer of board governance.

    Under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;2006 Stock
    Plan&#148;), each individual who first becomes a non-employee
    director will, at the time of his or her election to the board,
    receive an option grant to purchase a specified number of shares
    of our common stock and a restricted stock unit award covering
    an additional number of shares of our common stock, provided
    that such individual has not previously been in the employ of
    the Company or any of its parents or subsidiaries. The specific
    number of shares subject to the initial award will be determined
    by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, but
    will not exceed 10,000&#160;shares for the option component or
    3,000&#160;shares for the restricted stock unit component. In
    addition, on the date of each Annual Shareholders Meeting, each
    individual who will continue to serve as a non-employee director
    will automatically be granted an option to purchase a specified
    number of shares of our common stock and a restricted stock unit
    award covering an additional number of shares of our common
    stock, provided such individual has served as a non-employee
    director for at least six months. The specific number of shares
    subject to the annual award will be determined by the
    Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, but will not
    exceed 3,000&#160;shares for the option component or
    750&#160;shares for the restricted stock unit component. There
    will be no limit on the number of such annual awards any one
    eligible non-employee director may receive over his or her
    period of continued service on the Board of Directors, and
    non-employee directors who have previously been in the
    Company&#146;s employ will be eligible to receive one or more
    such annual awards over their period of service on the Board of
    Directors. Each initial stock option and restricted stock unit
    award will vest in four equal annual installments upon the
    individual&#146;s completion of each year of service. Each
    annual stock option and restricted stock award will vest in one
    installment upon the individual&#146;s completion of one year of
    board service.

    <I>Introduction.</I>&#160;&#160;It is our intent in this
    Compensation Discussion and Analysis to inform our shareholders
    of the policies and objectives underlying the compensation
    programs for our three executive officers, Dr.&#160;Ernest A.
    Bates, Chairman of our Board and our Chief Executive Officer,
    Craig K. Tagawa, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating
    Officer, and Ernest R. Bates, our Vice President of Sales and
    Business Development. The Compensation Committee of our Board of
    Directors administers the compensation programs for our
    executive officers with the objective of providing a competitive
    compensation package. However, we believe that the compensation
    paid to our executive officers should also be substantially
    dependent on our financial performance and the value created for
    our shareholders. For this reason, the Compensation Committee
    also utilizes our compensation programs to provide meaningful
    incentives for the attainment of our short-term and long-term
    strategic objectives and thereby reward those executive officers
    who make a substantial contribution to the attainment of those
    objectives.

    Each executive officer&#146;s compensation package typically
    consists of three elements: (i)&#160;a base salary, (ii)&#160;a
    cash bonus tied to our attainment of financial objectives or the
    individual officer&#146;s personal performance, and
    (iii)&#160;long-term, stock-based incentive awards designed to
    align and strengthen the mutuality of interests between our
    executive officers and our shareholders. In determining the
    appropriate level for each element of such compensation, the
    Compensation Committee subjectively reviews and evaluates the
    level of performance of the Company and the executive&#146;s
    level of individual performance and potential to contribute to
    the Company&#146;s future growth, and seeks to set compensation
    at a level that is both reasonable and equitable based on that
    assessment. Consistent with our philosophy of emphasizing pay
    for performance, the total compensation packages are designed to
    pay above the target when the Company exceeds its goals and
    below the target when the Company does not achieve its goals.

    <I>Elements of Compensation.</I>&#160;&#160;Each of the three
    major elements comprising the compensation package for our
    executive officers (salary, bonus and equity) is designed to
    achieve one or more of our overall objectives in fashioning a
    competitive level of compensation, tying compensation to the
    attainment of one or more of our strategic business objectives
    and subjecting a substantial portion of the executive
    officer&#146;s compensation to our financial success as measured
    in terms of our stock price performance. The manner in which the
    Compensation Committee has so structured each element of
    compensation may be explained as follows.

    <I><U>Base Salary.</U></I>&#160;&#160;The Compensation Committee
    reviews the base salary level of each executive officer each
    year. The base salary for the executive officers is determined
    on the basis of their level of responsibility, experience and
    individual performance. No changes were made in fiscal 2009.

    <I><U>Cash Incentive Compensation.</U></I>&#160;&#160;Because
    the Compensation Committee believes that the significant
    interests which Dr.&#160;Bates, Mr.&#160;Tagawa and
    Mr.&#160;Bates have in our common stock provide them with a
    substantial incentive to contribute to our financial success and
    the attainment of our financial goals, the Compensation
    Committee does not typically implement annual incentive
    compensation programs for them. From time to time, the
    Compensation Committee awards cash bonuses in recognition of
    their personal performance. However, for the 2009 fiscal year,
    no cash bonuses were awarded by the Compensation Committee to
    the Company&#146;s executive officers.

    <I><U>Equity Compensation.</U></I>&#160;&#160;In 2006 the Board
    approved the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;2006
    Plan&#148;) to replace the Company&#146;s 2001 Stock Option
    Plan, and the 2006 Plan was approved by our stockholders at the
    2006 Annual Meeting. For many years stock option grants were the
    sole form of equity award granted to our executive officers, and
    we continue to use stock option grants to provide long-term
    incentives to our executive officers. However, we structured the
    2006 Plan to provide us with more flexibility in designing
    equity incentives in an environment where a number of companies
    have moved from traditional option grants to other stock or
    stock-based awards, such as stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock and restricted stock units. Accordingly, with
    the 2006 Plan, we have a broad array of equity incentives to
    utilize for purposes of attracting and retaining the services of
    key individuals, including stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other
    stock-based awards. We continue to rely on equity incentives
    because we believe that such incentives are necessary for us to
    remain competitive in the marketplace for executive talent and
    other key employees.

    The Compensation Committee reviews and considers equity awards
    in connection with the annual review of the performance of our
    executive officers and other key employees. However, there may
    be variance from this practice when warranted by special
    circumstances. Each grant is designed to align the interests of
    the executive officer with those of the shareholders and to
    provide each individual with a significant incentive to manage
    the company from the perspective of an owner with an equity
    stake in the business. In past years, the equity awards have
    been in the form of stock options which generally vest and
    become exercisable in a series of installments over a five year
    service period, contingent upon the officer&#146;s continued
    employment with us. Accordingly, each such option will provide a
    return to the executive officer only to the extent he remains
    employed with us during the vesting period, and then only if the
    fair market value of the underlying shares appreciates over the
    period between grant and exercise of the option. No options were
    awarded to the Company&#146;s executive officers in 2009.

    <I>Market Timing of Equity Awards.</I>&#160;&#160;The
    Compensation Committee does not engage in any market timing of
    the equity awards made to the executive officers or other award
    recipients. As indicated above, awards for existing executive
    officers and employees are considered in connection with the
    annual review process which typically occurs in the fourth
    quarter each year. There is no established practice of timing
    our awards in advance of the release of favorable financial
    results or adjusting the award date in connection with the
    release of unfavorable financial developments affecting our
    business. Equity awards for new hires other than executive
    officers are typically made at the next scheduled Compensation
    Committee meeting following the employee&#146;s hire date. All
    stock option grants issued under our 2006 Plan have an exercise
    price per share no less than the fair market value per share on
    the grant date.

    $1.0&#160;million per covered officer in any year. The
    limitation applies only to compensation that is not considered

    The stock options which have been granted to date to our

    performance based compensation. Non-performance-based
    compensation paid to such officers for 2009 did not exceed the
    $1.0&#160;million limit per officer. However, we believe that in

    one of a number of relevant factors taken into consideration,

    Under our 2006 Stock Plan, in the event a change in control
    occurs, each outstanding equity award under the Discretionary
    Grant Program will automatically accelerate in full, unless
    (i)&#160;that award is assumed by the successor corporation or
    otherwise continued in effect or (ii)&#160;the award is replaced
    with a cash retention program that preserves the spread existing
    on the unvested shares subject to that equity award (the excess
    of the fair market value of those shares over the exercise or
    base price in effect for the shares) and provides for subsequent
    payout of that spread in accordance with the same vesting
    schedule in effect for those shares. In addition, all unvested
    shares outstanding under the Discretionary Grant and Stock
    Issuance Programs will immediately vest upon the change in
    control, except to the extent our repurchase rights with respect
    to those shares are to be assigned to the successor corporation
    or otherwise continued in effect. Each outstanding equity award
    under the Stock Issuance Program, including restricted stock
    units, will vest as to the number of shares of common stock
    subject to that award immediately prior to the change in control
    and the underlying shares will become immediately issuable,
    unless that equity award is assumed by the successor corporation
    or otherwise continued in effect or replaced with a cash
    retention program similar to the program described in

    to the closing selling price of our common stock on
    December&#160;31, 2009, which was $2.88 per share, the option

    recognized by the optionee at the time of the option grant, and
    no taxable income is recognized for regular tax purposes at the
    time the option is exercised, although taxable income may arise
    at that time for alternative minimum tax purposes. The optionee
    will recognize taxable income in the year in which the purchased
    shares are sold or otherwise made the subject of certain other
    dispositions. For Federal tax purposes, dispositions are divided
    into two categories: (i)&#160;qualifying, and
    (ii)&#160;disqualifying. A qualifying disposition occurs if the
    sale or other disposition is made more than two (2)&#160;years
    after the date the option for the shares involved in such sale
    or disposition is granted and more than one (1)&#160;year after
    the date the option is exercised for those shares. If the sale
    or disposition occurs before these two periods are satisfied,

    (i)&#160;the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition
    of the purchased shares over (ii)&#160;the exercise price paid
    for the shares. If there is a disqualifying disposition of the
    shares, then the excess of (i)&#160;the fair market value of
    those shares on the exercise date or (if less) the amount
    realized upon such sale or disposition over (ii)&#160;the
    exercise price paid for the shares will be taxable as ordinary
    income to the optionee. Any additional gain recognized upon the

    be charged as a direct compensation expense against our reported
    earnings over the requisite service period. For shares issuable
    upon the vesting of restricted stock units awarded under the
    Plan, we will be required to amortize over the requisite service
    period a compensation cost equal to the fair market value of the
    underlying shares on the date of the award. If any other shares
    are unvested at the time of their direct issuance, then the fair
    market value of those shares at that time will be charged to our
    reported earnings ratably over the requisite service period.
    Such accounting treatment for restricted stock units and direct
    stock issuances will generally be applicable whether vesting is
    tied to service periods or performance goals, although for
    performance-based awards, the grant date fair value will
    initially be determined on the basis of the probable outcome of
    performance goal attainment. The issuance of a fully-vested

    For performance units awarded under the Plan and payable in
    stock, we will be required to amortize, over the applicable
    performance period and any subsequent service vesting period, a
    compensation cost equal to the fair market value of the
    underlying shares on the date of the award. For performance
    units awarded under the 2010 Plan and payable in cash, we will
    amortize the potential cash expense over the applicable
    performance period and any subsequent service vesting period.
    Dividends or dividend equivalents paid on the portion of an
    award that vests will be charged against our retained earnings.
    However, if the award holder is not required to return the
    dividends or dividend equivalents if they forfeit their awards,
    such dividends or dividend equivalents paid on instruments that
    do not vest will be recognized by us as additional compensation
    cost.

    for such performance-based awards will be reversed if the
