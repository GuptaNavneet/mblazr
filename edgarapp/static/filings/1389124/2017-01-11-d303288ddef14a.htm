of the Trust Agreement and your written objection is actually received by the Fund before 5:00 p.m. New York Time, on January 30, 2017. This means that if you are in favor of the Proposal, not responding will have the same effect as responding with

Fund Management and will not have any right to participate in the management of Frontier Fund Management except in the event that Frontier Fund Management defaults on its obligation to pay certain required distributions to Equinox (described in
further detail in the Consent Solicitation). Wakefield will hold the controlling equity interest in Frontier Fund Management and will be responsible for the management and operations of Frontier Fund Management. In addition and as a condition of the
Unit Purchase Agreement, Equinox will enter into a transition services agreement pursuant to which it will, for a period not to exceed one year following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Unit Purchase Agreement, provide certain
services to support Frontier Fund Management as it assumes the role of Managing Owner, including, but not limited to, support services related to portfolio management and fund operations. Equinox may receive certain fees from Frontier Fund
Management in connection with such transition services. Under the transition services agreement, Equinox will perform the services with the same standard of care, skill and judgment as it used in acting as the Managing Owner. </P>

Management to ensure a smooth transition of services and responsibilities. After consideration of the commodity pool market generally and its goals specifically, Wakefield made the determination that it wanted to expand its presence in the U.S.

a Written Consent expressly indicating that it is NOT consenting or objecting in respect of your Units. This is referred to as a &#147;broker non-vote.&#148; Any broker non-vote will be interpreted as a consent and as an authorization to pursue the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">We are asking the Unitholders to adopt the Managing Owner Substitution Proposal because its adoption is a condition to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Unit Purchase Agreement. The Managing Owner is proposing to appoint Frontier Fund Management as its replacement, because Equinox would prefer to cease to be the Managing Owner and, upon the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Unit Purchase Agreement, Frontier Fund Management is willing to replace Equinox as the Managing Owner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="tx303288_6">
</A>Reason Equinox is Ceasing to Act as the Managing Owner </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">After consideration of the commodity pool market generally and its goals
specifically, Equinox made the determination that it would be in Equinox&#146;s best interest to transition managing owner responsibilities to Frontier Fund Management and focus Equinox&#146;s sales and marketing efforts on its mutual fund
offerings. Equinox fully intends to work with Wakefield and Frontier Fund Management to ensure a smooth transition of services and responsibilities. After consideration of the commodity pool market generally and its goals specifically, Wakefield
made the determination that it wanted to expand its presence in the U.S. commodity pool space. Wakefield also intends to launch other commodities-based products in the U.S. in order to respond to developments in the market and investor preferences.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">After the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Unit Purchase Agreement, Equinox will own a non-voting equity interest in Frontier
Fund Management, and Equinox and Wakefield, as the owners of Frontier Fund Management, will enter into an amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement for Frontier Fund Management. As a condition of the Unit Purchase Agreement,
Equinox will enter into a transition services agreement pursuant to which it will, for a period not to exceed one year following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Unit Purchase Agreement, provide certain services to support
Frontier Fund Management as it assumes the role of Managing Owner, including, but not limited to, support services related to portfolio management and fund operations. Equinox may receive certain fees from Frontier Fund Management in connection with
such transition services. Under the transition services agreement, Equinox will perform the services with the same standard of care, skill and judgment as it used in acting as the Managing Owner. In its capacity as an equityholder of Frontier Fund
Management, Equinox will have the right to receive certain required distributions, but will not have any right to manage the business or operations of Frontier Fund Management unless Frontier Fund Management defaults on its obligations to make
certain monthly and annual distributions to Equinox. Wakefield will hold the controlling equity interest in Frontier Fund Management and will be responsible for the management and operation of Frontier Fund Management. The monthly distributions
payable to Equinox in its capacity as an equityholder of Frontier Fund Management will be based on Equinox Frontier Fund&#146;s net revenues. Equinox will have no role in the management of Frontier Fund Management. In addition, both Equinox and
Frontier Fund Management will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the other&#146;s confidential information (including client information and records), subject to certain exceptions. </P>
