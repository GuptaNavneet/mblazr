adviser to the Fund under an investment advisory agreement between Advisors Preferred Trust and the Adviser. The Adviser has proposed
to the Advisors Preferred Trust Board of Trustees that Kensington Analytics, LLC serve as sub-adviser to the Adviser and the Fund.
Under this proposal, the Fund’s current portfolio manager (Bruce P. DeLaurentis) will continue to serve as portfolio manager.
However, if the proposal is approved by shareholders, Mr. DeLaurentis will provide portfolio management services to the Fund as
a member of the sub-adviser.</p>

a sub-advisory agreement under which Kensington Analytics, LLC will serve as sub-adviser to the Adviser and the Fund. However,
the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act") requires that Fund shareholders approve the sub-advisory agreement before
it can become effective. The approval of the sub-advisory agreement will not result in any change in advisory fees or any other
fees or expenses paid by the Fund.</p>

that it has adopted a Code of Ethics containing provisions reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons, as that term is defined

the Board also considered that the Adviser proposes to delegate day-to-day investment decisions of the Fund to the Sub-Adviser

will include, regular compliance reviews of the Sub-Adviser and its investment management processes and other administrative services.</p>

<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">With respect to the Sub-Adviser,
the Board considered the skills and experience of the Sub-Adviser portfolio manager and also considered that the Board had previously
received a presentation related to the Sub-Adviser portfolio manger's investment management and research techniques. The Board
also considered the Sub-Adviser's compliance policies and procedures which appeared to be capable of operating effectively, and
noted that the level of communication between the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser is expected to be effective. The Board also reviewed
a balance sheet for the parent of the Sub-Adviser and a representation from the Sub-Adviser that it has access to parent assets
if needed; and concluded it suggests that the Sub-Adviser has access to sufficient financial resources in addition to sub-advisory
fees to assure that the Sub-Adviser will be able to provide the agreed upon services to the Fund. The Board concluded that the
Sub-Adviser has sufficient quality and depth of personnel, resources, investment methods and compliance policies and procedures
essential to performing its duties under the Sub-Advisory Agreement and that the nature, overall quality and extent of the investment
management services to be provided by the Sub-Adviser are expected to be satisfactory.</p>

Trustees considered that the Adviser is proposing to delegate its day-to-day investment decisions to the Sub-Adviser and not directly
manage the investment decisions of the Fund. The Board noted, however, that the Adviser portfolio manager for the Fund will transition
to serving as Sub-Adviser portfolio manager for the Fund. Thus, the performance record for the Fund is relevant for evaluating
the Sub-Adviser. The Board considered the performance of the Fund (as measured by Institutional Class shares) for the various periods
ended March 31, 2020 as compared</p>

and strategy elements that contributed to the performance. They also noted that over the one-month, three-month and since-inception
periods, the Fund significantly outperformed the ICE BofAML High Yield Master II (LOC) Index, while lagging the Barclays U.S. Aggregate
Bond Index. The Trustees agreed the Fund was performing as intended relative to the ICE BofAML High Yield Master II (LOC) Index
and noted that performance relative to the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was included as a supplementary information point.

The Board considered the Fund's advisory fee as well as class-specific expenses. The Trustees noted that that advisory fee and
each share class' expenses were above average yet within the range of reasonable fees and expenses paid by funds in the Morningstar
High-Yield category. The Board also considered the proposed allocation of the responsibilities as between the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser,
finding that the Sub-Adviser will be responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and the Adviser will provide oversight,
administrative and support services to the Sub-Adviser, and determined that the allocation of the advisory fee was reasonable in
relation to the services rendered by each of the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser. The Board also noted that the Sub-Adviser has no
other mutual fund clients for fee comparison and that its sub-advisory fee is within the range of fees the Sub-Adviser proposes
to charge to separately managed accounts. The Board also noted that the Sub-Advisory fee increases slightly as Fund assets increase
as a means for the Adviser to reward the Sub-Adviser for Fund growth. The Board then concluded that the advisory and sub-advisory
fees were reasonable and that the overall expense ratio of each class was acceptable in light of the factors considered.</p>

<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><i>Profitability</i>. The
Board also considered the estimated profitability of the Sub-Adviser and whether such profits were reasonable in light of the services
to be provided to the Fund. The Board reviewed projected revenue and costs for the provision of services to the Fund and found
that at current and projected asset levels, the Sub-Adviser's levels of profitability from its sub-advisory relationship with the
Fund and Adviser represented a fair entrepreneurial profit and were not excessive. The Trustees noted that the Sub-Adviser intends
to expend its own resources in support of Fund promotion, which would reduce its profitability when the overall relationship with
the Fund is considered.</p>

The Board considered whether the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser will realize economies of scale with respect to their management of
the Fund. The Board reviewed and considered the profitability analyses and selected financial information of each of the Adviser
and Kensington Analytics, LLC and also took into account the current assets. The Board concluded that at current asset levels economies
of scale were not achievable, but would be revisited as the Fund grows in size or at a future time that the Board determines.</p>

to perform specialized services. As described above, the Trust currently retains the Adviser, located at 1445 Research Blvd., Suite
530, Rockville, MD 20850, as investment adviser to the Fund and proposes to retain Kensington Analytics, LLC, located at 3811 Bee
Caves Road, Suite 210, Austin, Texas 78746, as sub-adviser to the Fund. Gemini Fund Services, LLC, located at 80 Arkay Drive, Hauppauge,
New York 11788 ("Gemini") serves as the Fund's administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent. U.S. Bank N.A., located
at 425 Walnut Street, Cincinnati, OH 45202; and National Financial Services, LLC, located at 245 Summer Street Boston, MA 02210,
each serves as a custodian for the Fund. Ceros Financial Services, Inc. (the "Distributor"), located at 1445 Research
Blvd., Suite 530, Rockville, Maryland 20850 distributes shares of the Fund. The Distributor and Adviser are affiliates because
they are under common control.</p>

so that each shareholder has the opportunity to vote on the proposals to be considered at the Meeting. A proxy for voting your
shares at the Meeting is enclosed. The shares represented by each valid proxy received in time (before or at the Meeting) will
be voted at the Meeting as specified. If no specification is made, the shares represented by a duly executed proxy for the Fund
will be voted for approval of the proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement; and at the discretion of the holders of the proxy on any other
matter that may come before the Meeting. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (1) submitting a duly
executed proxy bearing a later date, (2) submitting a written notice to the President of the Trust revoking the proxy, or (3) attending
and voting in person at the Meeting. However, if coronavirus related safety considerations remain at the time of the Meeting, the
Meeting may be held electronically. If the meeting is held electronically, shareholders will be given timely notice as well as
instructions on how to attend and vote at the meeting.</p>

record of the Fund on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Meeting on any Proposals. Without distinction as to class of
shares, each shareholder of the Fund is entitled to one (1) vote per share held, and fractional votes for fractional shares held,
on any matter with respect to the Fund submitted to a vote at the Meeting.</p>
<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 37.45pt">An affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund is required for the approval of the Sub-Advisory Agreement.
The 1940 Act defines "majority of the outstanding voting shares" to mean the vote (i) of 67% or more of the voting securities
(i.e., shares) present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present
or represented by proxy; or (ii) of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, whichever is less. This means
that Proposal 1 may be approved by less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund, provided a quorum is present at
the Meeting.</p>
<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 37.45pt">In the event shareholders
of the Fund do not approve Proposal 1 at the Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or delay thereof, the Board will need to
consider appropriate action, which could include, among other things, seeking approval of a new sub-advisory agreement.</p>
<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 37.45pt">Broker non-votes
and abstentions will be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum and the number of shares of the
Fund represented at the Meeting, but they are not affirmative votes for any proposal. As a result, non-votes and abstentions will
have the same effect as a vote against Proposal 1 because the required vote is a percentage of the shares present or outstanding.</p>
<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 37.45pt">Under the rules
of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), if a NYSE-member broker has not received instructions from beneficial owners
or persons entitled to vote and the proposal to be voted upon may "affect substantially" a shareholder's rights or privileges,
the broker may not vote the shares as to that proposal even if it has discretionary voting power. As a result, these shares also
will be treated as broker non-votes for purposes of proposals that may "affect substantially" a shareholder's rights
or privileges (but will not be treated as broker non-votes for other proposals, including adjournment of the special meeting).
The NYSE considers Proposal 1 to be voted upon at the Meeting to be a non-routine matter that affects substantially a shareholder's
rights or privileges. Consequently, brokers holding shares of the Fund on behalf of clients may not vote on Proposal 1 absent instructions
from the beneficial owners of the shares.</p>
<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 37.45pt">Treating broker
non-votes as votes against a proposal can have the effect of causing shareholders who choose not to participate in the proxy vote

a proposal have not been obtained, then the Meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as
proxies may also adjourn the Meeting for any other reason in their discretion. Any adjourned Meeting may be held, within a reasonable
time after the date set for the original Meeting, without the necessity of further notice unless a new record date of the adjourned
Meeting is fixed. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies that such persons are required to vote FOR the Proposal
1, as well as proxies for which no vote has been directed, in favor of such an adjournment and will vote those proxies required
to be voted AGAINST such proposal against such adjournment. In determining whether to vote for adjournment, the persons named as
proxies shall consider all relevant factors, including the nature of the proposal, the percentage of votes then cast, the percentage
of negative votes then cast, the nature of the proposed solicitation activities and the nature of the reasons for such further
solicitation, in determining that an adjournment and additional solicitation is reasonable and in the interests of shareholders.
At any adjourned Meeting, the Trust may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original Meeting.</p>

<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Board is making
this solicitation of proxies. The total cost of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Special
Meeting, the proxy card and any additional materials relating to the Meeting, and the solicitation of proxies (as described below)
is anticipated to total approximately $25,000. These costs will be borne equally by the Adviser and proposed Sub-Adviser. The Trust
has engaged AST Fund Solutions ("AST"), a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation, if needed, of proxies
from brokers, banks, institutional holders and individual shareholders at an anticipated cost $5,000, including out of pocket expenses
and solicitation expenses associated with soliciting proxies that are related to Proposal 1. Fees and expenses may be greater depending
on the effort necessary to obtain shareholder votes. All proxy-related costs will be borne equally by the Adviser and proposed
Sub-Adviser, not the Fund.</p>
<p style="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Proxies are being
solicited by mail. Additional solicitations may be made by telephone, e-mail, or other personal contact by AST, officers of the
Trust, employees of Gemini, the Adviser or Kensington Analytics, LLC. As the Meeting date approaches, shareholders of the Fund
may receive a call from a representative of AST, officers of the Trust, employees of Gemini, the Adviser or Kensington Analytics,
LLC if the Fund has not yet received their vote. Authorization to permit the execution of proxies may be obtained by telephonic
instructions from Fund shareholders. Proxies that are obtained telephonically will be recorded. Management of the Fund believes
that these procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that the identity of the shareholder casting the vote is accurately determined
and that the voting instructions of the shareholder are accurately determined.</p>
