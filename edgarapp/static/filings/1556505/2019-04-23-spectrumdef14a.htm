February 2019, the owner of the Adviser, Advisors Preferred Holding, LLC, agreed to sell all of its ownership interest in the Adviser
to DGB Holdings LLC (&quot;DGB&quot;), a Delaware limited liability company (the &quot;Transaction&quot;). The Transaction will
result in a change of control of the Adviser, with DGB owning 100% of the Adviser. The Transaction will occur on or about May 31,
2019. The Transaction is deemed to be a &quot;change in control&quot; of the Adviser for the purpose of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;). Under the 1940 Act, a party owning, directly or indirectly, more than 25% of
the voting securities of a company is presumed to control the company, and any transaction that results in such owner reducing
its interest to less than 25% is presumed to constitute a change in control of an investment adviser. As a result of the Transaction,
the current advisory agreement between the Adviser and the Trust (the &quot;Current Advisory Agreement&quot;) will automatically
terminate on May 31, 2019, or such other date of the Transaction. </FONT></P>

an in-person meeting held on March 28, 2019 (the &quot;Board Meeting&quot;), in anticipation of the completion of the Transaction,
the Board approved the New Advisory Agreement. The New Advisory Agreement will not be effective until approved by a majority vote
of the outstanding shares of each Fund. The Adviser will continue to manage the Funds pursuant to the Current Advisory Agreement
or pursuant to an interim agreement until the New Advisory Agreement is approved by shareholders and the Transaction is complete.</FONT></P>

Transaction will not result in any change to either Funds' investment objectives and strategies. The Adviser's personnel who service
the Funds will remain the same. Approval of the New Advisory Agreement will not increase the advisory fees paid by the Funds or
its shareholders. For each Fund, the effective date of the New Advisory Agreement will be the closing date of the Transaction if
approved by the Fund&rsquo;s shareholders on or before the closing date of the Transaction, or if not approved by a Fund until
after the closing of the Transaction, the date it is approved by the Fund&rsquo;s shareholders. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">At the Board Meeting,
the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, considered the approval of the New Advisory Agreement and the New
Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Trustees also re-considered their recent deliberations made on November 13, 2018, when they renewed
the Current Advisory Agreement and Current Sub-Advisory Agreement as well as deliberated upon updated and supplemental information.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In connection with
the Board's consideration of the New Advisory Agreement and New Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Adviser and Spectrum Financial provided
the Board in advance of the meeting with written materials, which included information regarding: the nature, extent and quality
of the services provided by the Adviser and Spectrum Financial to the Funds; the investment performance of the Funds and Spectrum
Financial; the costs of the services to be provided to the Funds; the extent to which economies of scale benefit shareholders;
and the profits realized by the Adviser and Spectrum Financial and any affiliates from their relationship with the Funds.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Board's deliberations
are presented contemporaneously given the overlapping considerations, paralleled issues and conclusions drawn by the Board.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Nature, Extent
and Quality of Services</I>. With respect to the nature, extent and quality of services provided, the Board reviewed the Adviser&rsquo;s
and Spectrum Financial&rsquo;s Forms ADV, a description of the manner in which investment decisions are made for the Spectrum Funds
by Spectrum Financial, a description of the services provided by the Adviser and those services provided by Spectrum Financial,
a review of the experience of professional personnel performing services for each of the Funds, including the teams of individuals
that primarily monitor and execute the investment and administration processes, respectively, and a certification from each of
the Adviser and Spectrum Financial certifying that each has adopted a Code of Ethics containing provisions reasonably necessary
to prevent Access Persons, as that term is defined in Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, from engaging in conduct prohibited by Rule
17j-1(b)) and that each of the Adviser and sub-adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from
violating such Codes of Ethics.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In reaching their
conclusions, the Board considered that the Adviser delegates day-to-day investment decisions of the Spectrum Funds to Spectrum
Financial and that the Adviser generally provides management and operational oversight of the sub-adviser. The Board considered
the services provided by the Adviser to the Funds, noting that the Adviser monitors and evaluates the performance of the Spectrum
Funds on a continuous basis, executes trades for each of the Funds and provides various compliance and administrative functions
to the Spectrum Funds. The Board considered the scope of each of these services provided by the Adviser to the Spectrum Funds,
including the practices described by the Adviser for regular monitoring and review of the sub-adviser&rsquo;s activities, and concluded
that such practices were adequate. The Board then concluded that the Adviser had sufficient quality and depth of personnel, resources,
investment methods and compliance policies and procedures essential to performing its duties under the Advisory Agreement and that

by the Adviser to the Funds were satisfactory and reliable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">With respect to the
sub-adviser, the Board noted that Spectrum Financial is primarily responsible for the portfolio management of the Spectrum Funds,
and considered Spectrum Financial&rsquo;s services in that regard. The Board considered that Spectrum Financial creates and provides
a portfolio management program, performs research and development of advanced technical strategies applied to the Funds, and performs
analysis of the effectiveness of those strategies employed for each of the Funds. The Board considered the experience of Spectrum
Financial&rsquo;s portfolio management and research staff and the quality and sophistication of the portfolio management services
provided to the Funds, noting the differing strategies offered for each of the Spectrum Low Volatility Fund and the Spectrum Advisors
Preferred Fund, and found them to be appropriate. The Board also considered Spectrum Financial&rsquo;s operation of its compliance
program, and found that there have been no material compliance matters during the prior year. The Board concluded that Spectrum
Financial had sufficient quality and depth of personnel, resources, investment methods and compliance policies and procedures essential
to performing its duties under the Sub-Advisory Agreement and that the nature, overall quality and extent of the management services
provided to the Spectrum Funds was satisfactory and reliable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Performance.</I>
The Board considered that the Adviser generally delegates its day-to-day investment decisions to Spectrum Financial and therefore
was not responsible for the performance of the Funds&rsquo; portfolios. The Board considered the Adviser&rsquo;s other responsibilities
under the Advisory Agreement, including with respect to trade oversight, obtaining derivative agreements and reporting to the Board,
and concluded that the Adviser appears to be adequately monitoring Spectrum Financial&rsquo;s adherence to each Fund&rsquo;s investment
objective and appears to be carrying out its functions appropriately.</P>

Fund</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Board considered
the Fund&rsquo;s performance as compared to various benchmark indices and the Fund&rsquo;s Morningstar category, Non-Traditional
Bond. The Board reviewed one-year, three-year, five-year and since inception (December 16, 2013) periods through December 31, 2018,
and noted the Fund outperformed its primary benchmark, the S&amp;P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, for all periods. With regards to
the Fund&rsquo;s Morningstar Non-Traditional Bond category, for the one-year, three-year and five-year periods, the Fund outperformed
the category. The Board also considered the Fund&rsquo;s returns as compared to the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index, and found that
while the Fund outperformed for the one-year period, it lagged for all other periods. The Board observed that the Fund&rsquo;s
returns were positive for all periods and the Fund&rsquo;s returns were not expected to be highly correlated to the returns of
an equity index. Specifically, the Board noted that with respect to major stock market indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 Total Return
Index, the Fund&rsquo;s investment objective was total return with lower downside volatility and risk compared to major stock market
indices. The Board concluded that performance was satisfactory.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify">not expected to track the S&amp;P 500
Total Return Index, in part because its investment objective had a long term element, the Fund did not employ an index-tracking
strategy, and the principal strategy included non-equity instruments. The Board considered that the Fund only slightly lagged the
Morningstar Multi-Alternative category for the one-year period, and significantly outperformed over the three-year period. The
Board concluded that the performance and strategy implementation by Spectrum Financial was satisfactory, and that Spectrum Financial
was expected to continue to obtain an acceptable level of investment returns for shareholders over the long term.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Fees and Expenses</I>.
The Board reviewed comprehensive comparison reports of each Fund&rsquo;s expense ratio as detailed below:</P>

Fund</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">With respect to the
costs of the services rendered by each of the Adviser and sub-adviser to the Fund, the Trustees first considered the level of overall
advisory fees, noting that the Fund&rsquo;s annual advisory fee was 2.15%, from which the sub-advisor received 1.80%. The Board
considered the Fund&rsquo;s management fee as compared to that of funds included in a universe composed of the Morningstar Multi-Alternative,
Non-Traditional Bond, and Long/Short Equity/Credit categories and noted the advisory fee was within a range of peer fund fees when
the categories are viewed as a group. The Board considered Spectrum Financial&rsquo;s tactical and complex investment approach
as a factor in considering the higher rate for its sub-advisory services as compared to other mutual funds and concluded that the
advisory fee was not unreasonable for this niche Fund. The Board also noted that the Fund&rsquo;s total expense ratio (Investor
Class shares) of 3.10% was reasonable as it was within the range of peer fund fees when the above Morningstar categories were viewed
as a group. The Board also considered the allocation of the advisory fee between the Adviser and sub-adviser and concluded that
the allocation of the advisory fee was reasonable in relation to the services rendered by the Adviser and sub-adviser, respectively.
The Board also took into account that fees charged by Spectrum Financial for its investment management of separately managed accounts
utilizing a substantially similar strategy as that of the Spectrum Low Volatility Fund were higher than the fee imposed on the
Fund.</P>

Preferred Fund</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Board compared
the Fund&rsquo;s overall advisory fee of 1.50%, from which 1.15% was paid to Spectrum Financial, to that of similarly sized funds
within the Morningstar Multi-Alternative Category, and found that while the Fund&rsquo;s advisory fee was higher than average of
the category, it was not the highest and was within a range of fees charged by comparable funds. The Trustees further considered
the allocation of the advisory fee as between the Adviser and sub-adviser and determined it was reasonable in relation to the services
rendered by the Adviser and sub-adviser, respectively. In addition, the Board reviewed the level of overall fees paid by the Fund,
and found the Fund&rsquo;s total expenses ratio (Investor Class shares) of 2.63% was within the range of the Multi-Alternative
category. The Trustees concluded that advisory fees for the Fund were not unreasonable.</P>

The Board considered the profitability of each of the Adviser and sub-adviser, respectively, and whether such profits were reasonable
in light of the services provided to each Fund as detailed below. The Board reviewed profitability analyses prepared by each of
the Adviser and sub-adviser for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2018. The Board also received representations that profitability
had not materially changed since September 30,</P>

earned on Fund portfolio transaction by the Adviser&rsquo;s affiliate. The Board concluded that neither the Adviser nor Spectrum
Financial had realized meaningful profits from its service to either Fund and therefore excessive profits were not a concern at
this time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Economies of Scale</I>.
The Board considered whether the Adviser and sub-adviser had or would realize economies of scale with respect to their management
of the Spectrum Funds. The Board reviewed and considered the profitability analyses and selected financial information of each
of the Adviser and sub-adviser and also took into consideration the expected growth of the Spectrum Funds and concluded that at
current asset levels economies of scale were not achievable for the Spectrum Advisors Preferred Fund. The Board noted that, for
the Spectrum Low Volatility Fund, economies of scale might be achieved at $200 million, and would be revisited as the Fund grows.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Conclusion</I>.
Having requested and received such information from each of the Adviser and Spectrum Financial as the Board believed to be reasonably
necessary to evaluate the terms of the Advisory Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement, respectively, with respect to each of the
Spectrum Low Volatility Fund and the Spectrum Advisors Preferred Fund and as assisted by the advice of independent counsel, the
Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, determined that approval of the Advisory Agreement and the Sub-Advisory
Agreement for each Fund was in the best interests of the Spectrum Funds and their current and future shareholders. Furthermore,
the Board concluded the Transaction would not result in an unfair burden to either Fund&rsquo;s shareholders.</P>

of 67% or more of the voting securities (i.e., shares) present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding
voting securities of a Fund are present or represented by proxy; or (ii) of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 37.45pt">Under the rules
of the New York Stock Exchange (&quot;NYSE&quot;), if a broker has not received instructions from beneficial owners or persons
entitled to vote and the proposal to be voted upon may &quot;affect substantially&quot; a shareholder's rights or privileges, the
broker may not vote the shares as to that proposal even if it has discretionary voting power. As a result, these shares also will
be treated as broker non-votes for purposes of proposals that may &quot;affect substantially&quot; a shareholder's rights or privileges
(but will not be treated as broker non-votes for other proposals, including adjournment of the special meeting). The NYSE considers
the proposals to be voted upon at the Meeting to be non-routine matters that affect substantially a shareholders' rights or privileges.
Consequently, brokers holding shares of the Funds on behalf of clients may not vote on Proposals 1 and 2 absent instructions from
the beneficial owners of the shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 37.45pt">Treating broker
non-votes as votes against a proposal can have the effect of causing shareholders who choose not to participate in the proxy vote
to prevail over shareholders who cast votes or provide voting instructions to their brokers or nominees. In order to prevent this
result, the Trust may request that selected brokers or nominees refrain from returning proxies on behalf of shares for which voting
instructions have not been received from beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote. The Trust also may request that selected
brokers or nominees return proxies on behalf of shares for which voting instructions have not been received if doing so is necessary
to obtain a quorum.</P>

a proposal have not been obtained, then the Meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as
proxies may also adjourn the Meeting for any other reason in their discretion. Any adjourned Meeting may be held, within a reasonable

this solicitation of proxies. The total cost of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Special
Meeting, the proxy card and any additional materials relating to the Meeting, and the solicitation of proxies (as described below)
which is anticipated to total approximately $21,475 (including the same costs of other proxies that are related to the Transaction
for other funds advised by the Adviser). These costs will be borne by the Adviser. The Trust has engaged AST Fund Solutions (&quot;AST&quot;),
a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from brokers, banks, institutional holders and individual shareholders
at an anticipated cost $11,922, including out of pocket expenses and solicitation expenses associated with soliciting proxies that
are related to the Transaction from other funds advised by the Adviser. Fees and expenses may be greater depending on the effort
necessary to obtain shareholder votes.</P>

solicited by mail. Additional solicitations may be made by telephone, e-mail, or other personal contact by AST, officers of the
Trust or employees of Gemini and the Adviser. As the Meeting date approaches, shareholders of the Funds may receive a call from
a representative of AST, the Trust, Gemini, the Distributor or the Adviser if the Funds have not yet received their vote. Authorization
to permit the execution of proxies may be obtained by telephonic instructions from the Funds' shareholders. Proxies that are obtained
telephonically will be recorded in accordance with the procedures set forth below. Management of the Funds believes that these
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that the identity of the shareholder casting the vote is accurately determined and
that the voting instructions of the shareholder are accurately determined.</P>

that the Trust did not have notice of a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement, the persons named as proxies
will vote the shares represented by the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best judgment, and discretionary authority
to do so is included in the proxy.</P>
