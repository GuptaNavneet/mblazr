February 2019, the sole owner of the Adviser, Advisors Preferred Holding, LLC, agreed to sell all of its ownership interest in
the Adviser to DGB Holdings LLC (&quot;DGB&quot;), a Delaware limited liability company (the &quot;Transaction&quot;). The Transaction
will result in a change of control of the Adviser, with DGB owning 100% of the Adviser. The Transaction will occur on or about
May 31, 2019. The Transaction is deemed to be a &quot;change in control&quot; of the Adviser for the purpose of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &quot;1940 Act&quot;). Under the 1940 Act, a party owning, directly or indirectly, more than
25% of the voting securities of a company is presumed to control the company, and any transaction that results in such owner reducing
its interest to less than 25% is presumed to constitute a change in control of an investment adviser. As a result of the Transaction,
the current advisory agreement between the Adviser and the Trust (the &quot;Current Advisory Agreement&quot;) will automatically
terminate on May 31, 2019, or such other date of the Transaction. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">At the Board Meeting,
the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, considered the approval of the New Advisory Agreement and the New
Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Trustees also re-considered their recent deliberations made on November 13, 2018, when they renewed
the Current Advisory Agreement and Current Sub-Advisory Agreement as well as deliberated upon updated and supplemental information.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In connection with
the Board's consideration of the New Advisory Agreement and New Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Adviser and Price Capital provided
the Board in advance of the meeting with written materials, which included information regarding: the nature, extent and quality
of the services provided by the Adviser and Price Capital to the Fund; the investment performance of the Fund and Price Capital;
the costs of the services to be provided to the Fund; the extent to which economies of scale benefit shareholders; and the profits
realized by the Adviser and Price Capital and any affiliates from their relationship with the Fund.</P>

a description of the services provided by the Adviser and those services provided by Price Capital and executed by the Adviser,

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In reaching their
conclusions, the Board considered that the Adviser delegates day-to-day investment decisions of the Fund to Price Capital and that
the Adviser generally provides management and operational oversight of Price Capital. The Board considered the services provided
by the Adviser to the Fund, including an ongoing program of monitoring and oversight of Price Capital, regular compliance reviews
of Price Capital and its investment management processes, trade execution, and other administrative services. The Board noted the
Adviser appeared to be adequately carrying out its intended functions and had not reported any material compliance matters. The
Board concluded that the Adviser had sufficient quality and depth of personnel, resources, investment methods and compliance policies
and procedures essential to performing its duties under the Advisory Agreement and that the nature, overall quality and extent
of the management services provided by the Adviser to the Fund were satisfactory and reliable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">With respect to Price
Capital, the Trustees considered that Price Capital was primarily responsible for the Fund's investment management. The Board considered
Price Capital's skills and experience and also considered that the Board received a presentation related to Price Capital's portfolio
management and research techniques. The Board also considered that Price Capital's compliance policies and procedures appeared
to be operating effectively, and that the level of communication between the Adviser and Price Capital appeared to be effective.
The Board concluded that Price Capital had sufficient quality and depth of personnel, resources, investment methods and compliance
policies and procedures essential to performing its duties under the Sub-advisory Agreement and that the nature, overall quality
and extent of the management services provided by Price Capital to the Fund was satisfactory and reliable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Performance</I>.
The Trustees considered that the Adviser generally delegated its day-to-day investment decisions to Price Capital and did not directly
manage the investment decisions of the Fund. However, the Adviser provided support to Price Capital in the execution of its investment
strategy, including with respect to trade oversight, obtaining derivative agreements and reporting to the Board. The Board considered
that the Adviser appeared to be adequately monitoring Price Capital's adherence to the Fund's investment objective and to be carrying
out its functions appropriately, including with respect to compliance and trade execution.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">With respect to the
performance of Price Capital, the Board considered the performance of the Fund (Investor Class shares) for the various periods
ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the Barclays 1-3 Month Treasury Index, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, S&amp;P 500
Index, and Morningstar Multi-Alternative category for each of the one-year, three-year, five-year, and since inception periods,

of the interaction between market conditions and strategy elements that contributed to the somewhat disappointing one-year performance.
They also noted that over the long term, performance was generally favorable, although somewhat mixed across all comparative benchmarks.
The Board noted that with respect to comparison to the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index, the Fund's investment objective was total
return with lower volatility and downside risk than that of equity market indices. The Trustees agreed the Fund was performing
as intended over the long term. Overall, the Trustees concluded that performance was satisfactory.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Fees and Expenses</I>.
The Board considered the Fund's unitary fee, under which the Fund pays the Adviser an annual fee of 2.50%, and the Adviser pays
the Fund&rsquo;s ordinary operating expenses, excluding distribution and shareholder servicing fees. They reviewed the advisory
fees paid by similarly sized funds in each of the Morningstar Multi-Alternative, Non-Traditional Bond, and Long/Short Equity/Credit
categories and found the Fund's fee to be above the highest of each category. The Board noted that the advisory fees of those comparable
funds were not a complete basis for determining the reasonableness of the Fund's unitary fee because traditional advisory agreements
do not require the adviser to pay fund operating expenses. They discussed the advisory fee compared to average total expenses of
the categories. The Board considered the Fund's total expense ratio of 3.13% for the Fund's Investor Class was higher than the
average of each of the Morningstar Multi-Alternative, Non-traditional Bond and Long/Short Equity/Credit, but lower than the maximum
expense ratios in the Multi-Alternative and Long/Short Equity/Credit categories.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Board also considered
the allocation of the responsibilities as between the Adviser and Price Capital, finding that Price Capital was responsible for
the management of the Fund's portfolio and the Adviser provides oversight, administrative and support services to Price Capital,
and determined that the allocation was reasonable in relation to the services rendered by each of the Adviser and Price Capital.
The Board then concluded that the advisory and sub-advisory fees were not unreasonable and that the overall expense ratio was acceptable
in light of the factors considered.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Profitability</I>.
The Board also considered the profitability of each of the Adviser and Price Capital, respectively, and whether such profits were
reasonable in light of the services provided to the Fund. The Board reviewed prior profitability analyses prepared by each of the
Adviser and Price Capital for 12 months ended June 30, 2018 and received representations from each that there have been no subsequent
material changes in profitability. With respect to the Adviser, the Board considered brokerage fees earned by the Adviser&rsquo;s
affiliate. They also considered that the Adviser was responsible for the payment of operational Fund expenses as well as the cost
of providing its advisory services, and found that at current asset levels the Adviser's relationship with the Fund was slightly
profitable and not excessive.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">With respect to the
sub-adviser, the Board similarly considered the recent reduction in the Fund's assets, and Price Capital's costs for the provision

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Economies of Scale</I>.
The Board considered whether the Adviser and Price Capital would realize economies of scale with respect to their management of
the Fund. The Board reviewed and considered the profitability analyses and selected financial information of each of the Adviser
and Price Capital and also took into account the current assets. The Board concluded that at current asset levels economies of
scale were not achievable, but would be revisited as the Fund grows in assets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 12pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Conclusion. Having
requested and received such information from each of the Adviser and Price Capital as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary
to evaluate the terms of the New Advisory Agreement and New Sub-Advisory Agreement, respectively, and as assisted by the advice
of independent counsel, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, determined that approval of the New Advisory
Agreement and the New Sub-Advisory Agreement for the Fund was in the best interests of the Fund and its current and future shareholders.
Furthermore, the Board concluded the Transaction would not result in an unfair burden to the Fund&rsquo;s shareholders.</P>

series of the Trust, an open-end investment company established under the laws of Delaware by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust
dated April 15, 2012. The Board oversees the activities of the Fund. Like other mutual funds, the Trust retains various organizations
to perform specialized services. As described above, the Trust currently retains the Adviser, located at 1445 Research Blvd., Suite
530, Rockville, MD 20850, as investment adviser to the Fund and Price Capital, located at 85 Chanteclaire Circle, Gulf Breeze,
FL 32561, as sub-adviser to the Fund. Gemini Fund Services, LLC, located at 80 Arkay Drive, Hauppauge, New York 11788 (&quot;Gemini&quot;)
serves as the Fund's administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent. U.S. Bank N.A., located at 425 Walnut Street, Cincinnati,
OH 45202, serves as Custodian for the Fund. Ceros Financial Services, Inc. (the &quot;Distributor&quot;), located at 1445 Research
Blvd., Suite 530, Rockville, Maryland 20850 distributes shares of the Fund. The Distributor and Adviser are affiliates because
they are under common control.</P>

vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund is required for the approval of the New Advisory Agreement

of 67% or more of the voting securities (i.e., shares) present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding
voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy; or (ii) of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities

the broker may not vote the shares as to that proposal even if it has discretionary voting power. As a result, these shares also
will be treated as broker non-votes for purposes of proposals that may &quot;affect substantially&quot; a shareholder's rights
or privileges (but will not be treated as broker non-votes for other proposals, including adjournment of the special meeting).
The NYSE considers the proposals to be voted upon at the Meeting to be non-routine matters that affect substantially a shareholder's
rights or privileges. Consequently, brokers holding shares of the Fund on behalf of clients may not vote on Proposals 1 and 2 absent
instructions from the beneficial owners of the shares.</P>

non-votes as votes against a proposal can have the effect of causing shareholders who choose not to participate in the proxy vote
to prevail over shareholders who cast votes or provide voting instructions to their brokers or nominees. In order to prevent this
result, the Trust may request that selected brokers or nominees refrain from returning proxies on behalf of shares for which voting
instructions have not been received from beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote. The Trust also may request that selected
brokers or nominees return proxies on behalf of shares for which voting instructions have not been received if doing so is necessary
to obtain a quorum.</P>

in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast more than 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting shall
constitute a quorum. If (1) a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or (2) a quorum is present but sufficient votes in favor of
a proposal have not been obtained, then the Meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as
proxies may also adjourn the Meeting for any other reason in their discretion. Any adjourned Meeting may be held, within a reasonable
time after the date set for the original Meeting, without the necessity of further notice unless a new record date of the adjourned
Meeting is fixed. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies that such persons are required to vote FOR the proposal,
as well as proxies for which no vote has been directed, in favor of such an adjournment and will vote those proxies required to
be voted AGAINST such proposal against such adjournment. In determining whether to vote for adjournment, the persons named as proxies
shall consider all relevant factors, including the nature of the proposal, the percentage of votes then cast, the percentage of
negative votes then cast, the nature of the proposed solicitation activities and the nature of the reasons for such further solicitation,
in determining that an adjournment and additional solicitation is reasonable and in the interests of shareholders. At any adjourned
Meeting, the Trust may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original Meeting.</P>

as proxies will vote in accordance with the shareholder's direction, as indicated thereon, if the proxy card is received and is
properly executed. If a shareholder properly executes a proxy and gives no voting instructions with respect to a proposal, the
shares will be voted in favor of such proposal. The proxies, in their discretion, may vote upon such other matters as may properly
come before the Meeting. The Board is not aware of any other matters to come before the Meeting.</P>

in a timely manner does not insure its inclusion in its proxy materials, because there are other requirements in the proxy rules

requirement under the 1940 Act, which must be met by convening such a shareholder meeting. Any shareholder proposals should be

this solicitation of proxies. The total cost of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Special
Meeting, the proxy card and any additional materials relating to the Meeting, and the solicitation of proxies (as described below)
which is anticipated to total approximately $21,475 (including the same costs of other proxies that are related to the Transaction
for other funds advised by the Adviser). These costs will be borne by the Adviser. The Trust has engaged AST Fund Solutions (&quot;AST&quot;),
a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from brokers, banks, institutional holders and individual shareholders
at an anticipated cost $11,922, including out of pocket expenses and solicitation expenses associated with soliciting proxies that
are related to the Transaction from other funds advised by the Adviser. Fees and expenses may be greater depending on the effort
necessary to obtain shareholder votes.</P>
