<p style="font-weight: bold">EXPLANATORY NOTES</p>

<p>The Southfield Town Center Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 7.6% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date, is an asset of the issuing entity and&#160; is part of a loan combination that includes the Southfield Town Center Mortgage Loan and one other pari passu loan that is not an asset of the issuing entity. This loan combination, including the Southfield Town Center Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>

<p>The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the Bronx Terminal Market Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 9.9% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The Bronx Terminal Market Mortgage Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the Bronx Terminal Market Mortgage Loan and two other pari passu loans that are not assets of the issuing entity. A pari passu portion of the loan combination was securitized in the COMM 2014-CCRE17 Mortgage Trust transaction, Commission File Number 333-193376-05 (the &#8220;<u>COMM 2014-CCRE17 Transaction</u>&#8221;). This loan combination, including the Bronx Terminal Market Mortgage Loan, is being serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the COMM 2014-CCRE17 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>

<p>The Exhibit Index describes exhibits provided by certain parties (in their capacities indicated on the Exhibit Index) with respect to the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 9.5% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan is an asset of the issuing entity and is part of a loan combination that includes the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan and three other pari passu loans, which are not assets of the issuing entity. This loan combination, including the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan, was serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for the issuing entity prior to the closing of the securitization of a pari passu portion of the State Farm Portfolio loan combination in the COMM 2014-UBS5 Mortgage Trust transaction, Commission File Number 333-193376-10 (the &#8220;<u>COMM 2014-UBS5 Transaction</u>&#8221;). After the closing of the COMM 2014-UBS5 Transaction on September 23, 2014, the loan combination, including the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan, was, and will continue to be, serviced and administered pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement with respect to the COMM 2014-UBS5 Transaction, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4.3 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (&#8220;<u>Wells Fargo</u>&#8221;) is the master servicer of the loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the primary servicer of the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the certificate administrator of the loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan. Thus, Wells Fargo is a &#8220;servicer,&#8221; as defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, with respect to these loans because it is servicing mortgage loans which constituted 10% or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants&#8217; attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Wells Fargo in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index.</p>

<p>U.S. Bank National Association acts as trustee of the issuing entity and the Bronx Terminal Market Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the pooling and servicing agreement relating to the COMM 2014-CCRE17 Transaction, respectively, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements). However, the trustee is not required to deliver such assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria with respect to any reporting period during which there was no servicing criteria applicable to the trustee, as was the case during the reporting period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the master servicer covers Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB.</p>

<p>Wilmington Trust, National Association acts as trustee with respect to the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement relating to the COMM 2014-UBS5 Transaction, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements). However, the trustee is not required to deliver such assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria with respect to any reporting period during which there was no servicing criteria applicable to the trustee, as was the case during the reporting period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the Master Servicer covers Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB.</p>

<p>This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountant's attestation reports from CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC. These entities were engaged by the master servicer and the primary servicer of the State Farm Portfolio Mortgage Loan to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information, and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These services are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii). Therefore, under the principles-based definition of &#8220;servicer&#8221; set forth in Item 1101(j) that looks to the functions that an entity performs, these vendors are &#8220;servicers&#8221; for the purposes of Item 1122. See Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)).</p>

<p>Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.</p>

<p>The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to UBS Real Estate Securities Inc., a Sponsor and a mortgage loan seller, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as certificate administrator, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as certificate administrator:</p>

<p>UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. (&#8220;<u>UBSRES</u>&#8221;) is currently engaged in litigation with respect to various legacy residential mortgage-backed securities transactions. Some litigants are seeking the repurchase of mortgage loans by UBSRES from certain residential mortgage securitization trusts, on the basis that the loans are allegedly in breach of contractual representations and warranties in governing transaction documents. Other litigants are&#160; alleging violations of federal and/or state securities or common law for alleged misrepresentations and omissions in offering documents in connection with the issuance and/or distribution of residential mortgage-backed securities. No assurance can be given that one or more of the foregoing actions will not result in material liability to UBSRES.</p>

<p>In June 2014, a civil complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, by a group of institutional investors against U.S. Bank National Association (&#8220;<u>U.S. Bank</u>&#8221;), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities (&#8220;<u>RMBS</u>&#8221;) trusts. The plaintiffs are investment funds formed by nine investment advisors (AEGON, BlackRock, Brookfield, DZ Bank, Kore, PIMCO, Prudential, Sealink and TIAA) that purport to be bringing suit derivatively on behalf of 841 RMBS trusts that issued $771 billion in original principal amount of securities between 2004 and 2008. According to the plaintiffs, cumulative losses for these RMBS trusts equal $92.4 billion as of the date of the complaint. The complaint is one of six similar complaints filed against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo) by certain of these plaintiffs. The complaint against U.S. Bank alleges the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and asserts causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaint also asserts that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by appropriate standards of care following events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount and equitable relief. In November 2014, the plaintiffs sought leave to voluntarily dismiss their original state court complaint and filed a substantially similar complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The federal civil complaint added a class action allegation and a change in the total number of named trusts to 843 RMBS trusts. In December 2014, the plaintiffs&#8217; motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court complaint was granted. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have previously been filed against U.S. Bank and other trustees by RMBS investors in other transactions.</p>

<p>There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs&#8217; claims vigorously.</p>

<p>On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (&#8220;<u>RMBS</u>&#8221;) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the &#8220;<u>Complaint</u>&#8221;). In December 2014, the plaintiffs&#8217; motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and other trustees by RMBS investors in these and other transactions. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs&#8217; claims vigorously.</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (&#8220;<u>DBTCA</u>&#8221;) has been named as a defendant in civil litigation concerning its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage backed securities (&#8220;<u>RMBS</u>&#8221;) trusts. On June 18, 2014, a group of investors (&#8220;<u>Plaintiff Investors</u>&#8221;) filed a civil action against DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (&#8220;<u>DBNTC</u>&#8221;) in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBTCA's and DBNTC's alleged failure to perform their obligations as trustees for the trusts (the &#8220;<u>NY Derivative Action</u>&#8221;). An amended complaint was filed on July 16, 2014, adding Plaintiff Investors and RMBS trusts to the NY Derivative Action. On November 24, 2014, the Plaintiff Investors moved to voluntarily dismiss the NY Derivative Action without prejudice. Also on November 24, 2014, substantially the same group of Plaintiff Investors filed a civil action against DBTCA and DBNTC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the &#8220;<u>SDNY Action</u>&#8221;), making substantially the same allegations as the New York Derivative Action with respect to 564 RMBS trusts (542 of which were at issue in the NY Derivative Action). The SDNY Action is styled both as a derivative action on behalf of the named RMBS Trusts and, in the alternative, as a putative class action on behalf of holders of RMBS representing interests in those RMBS trusts. DBTCA is vigorously defending the SDNY Action. DBTCA has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA's present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in this paragraph) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders.</p>

<p>Management&#8217;s assessment of compliance with Regulation AB servicing criteria furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by KeyBank National Association (&#8220;<u>KeyBank</u>&#8221;) attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 33.8 (the &#8220;<u>KeyBank Assessment</u>&#8221;) identified the following material instances of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xv) during the calendar year ended December 31, 2014 with respect to commercial mortgage loans.</p>

<p><u>Servicing Criteria Impacted:</u></p>

<p>1122(d)(4)(xv) &#8211;Any external enhancement or other support, identified in Item 1114(a)(1) through (3) or item 1115 of Regulation AB, is maintained as set forth in the transaction agreements.</p>

<p><u>Material Instances of Noncompliance with Servicing Criteria:</u></p>

<p>Regarding external enhancements, specifically letters of credit, upon transfer of the servicing of the mortgage loans to KeyBank from the previous servicer, KeyBank was not properly named as the beneficiary on certain letters of credit because of deficiencies in policies and procedures relating to changes in named beneficiary.&#160; KeyBank identified eighty mortgage loans that did not properly name KeyBank as beneficiary on the letters of credit.</p>

<p><u>Remediation:</u></p>

<p>The following remediation procedures have been initiated by KeyBank: (i) the impacted mortgage loans have been identified, (ii) borrower contact has been initiated, (iii) corrective actions are underway and are being tracked and monitored by senior management, (iv) procedures have been revised to include new tracking and action steps to prevent this situation from reoccurring in the future, and (v) training has been provided to the relevant staff members to prevent a recurrence, and (vi) updates will be made to software systems to assist staff members with compliance.</p>

<p>As of the date of the KeyBank Assessment, there are thirty-one mortgage loans contained within fourteen transactions for which the beneficiary name on the letters of credit still needs to be corrected.&#160; The fourteen transactions are listed below, with the following information with respect to each transaction: the number of impacted mortgage loans to be corrected included in such transaction, and the aggregate amount of the letters of credit related to such impacted mortgage loans to be corrected.</p>
