<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to
vote generally for the election of directors is necessary to constitute a quorum at the meeting.
Abstentions and broker &#147;non-votes&#148; are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of
determining a quorum. A broker &#147;non-vote&#148; occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial
owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary power
with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plurality of the votes cast by the shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled
to vote is required to elect directors. With regard to the election of directors, you may vote in
favor of, or withhold your vote from, each nominee. Abstentions and broker &#147;non-votes&#148; will have no
effect on the outcome of the election of directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A majority of votes cast by the shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to
vote is required for the approval of the proposed Hudson Valley Holding Corp. 2010 Omnibus
Incentive Plan. Abstentions and broker &#147;non-votes&#148; will have no effect on determining whether the
requisite number of affirmative votes has been received.

at the Company to Wendy Croker, First Vice President, Shareholder Relations, or via facsimile

instructions, the shares represented thereby will be voted in favor of the nominated slate of
directors, in favor of the Hudson Valley Holding Corp. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and in favor of
the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm, each as
recommended by the Board of Directors.

can do so in one of three ways. First, you can send a written notice to our transfer agent,

Singer and Messrs.&nbsp;Holcombe, Ifshin, Mulrow, Pratt and Thompson meet the standards of independence
for board members. In addition to the transactions disclosed under &#147;Transactions with Related
Persons&#148; on page 39, the Board of Directors considered the banking relationship that exists
between HVB and Ms.&nbsp;Foster, Ms.&nbsp;Singer and Messrs.&nbsp;Ifshin, Holcombe, Mulrow, Pratt and Thompson in
determining each director&#146;s independence. Since these banking products and services are provided in
the normal course of business and are available on the same basis as to customers in general, the
Board of Directors concluded that these relationships do not affect the directors&#146; independence.
The Board of Directors also concluded that those transactions disclosed under &#147;Transactions with

often be made by the full Board of Directors of the Company or HVB, or by a standing committee of
the Board of Directors of HVB. Other than Michael P. Maloney, no other director attended fewer than
75&nbsp;percent of the meetings of the Board and the Committees of the Board on which he or she has

that the nominating function and the Board&#146;s process effectively achieved the Nominating

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Nominating Committee charter sets forth new director qualifications standards. The
charter states that qualified individuals are selected for, among other things, their integrity,
independence, diversity of experience, community service, their ability to exercise sound judgment,
and the ability to make the time commitment necessary to be an effective member of the Board of
Directors. The charter also provides that as a general rule, it is the desire of the Board of
Directors that directors live and/or work in the communities served by the Bank. The charter
further requires that directors be experienced in business, financially literate and respected
members of their communities, and they are expected to assist the Company in developing new
business. Moreover, directors must have high ethical and moral standards and sound personal
finances. Should a director become involved in conduct which is detrimental to the Company&#146;s
reputation, he or she should resign from the Board of Directors. Such conduct includes, among
other acts, personal bankruptcy, federal or state indictments, convictions of a crime, professional
misconduct or unethical practices. In addition, the Nominating Committee charter provides that

leadership skills and have experience and judgment in areas that are relevant to our business. We
believe that their ability to challenge and stimulate management and their dedication to the
affairs of the Company collectively serve the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The

the right of the optionee to exercise any outstanding, vested options will terminate on the date of
such termination of employment. If an optionee&#146;s employment terminates for any other reason,
including the voluntary resignation of the optionee, the right of the optionee to exercise any

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the 2010 Plan, eligible employees may be granted the following benefits: incentive

the grant or exercise of an option that qualifies as an incentive stock option under Section&nbsp;422 of
the Code. If common stock is issued to an optionee upon exercise of an ISO, and if the optionee
does not dispose of those shares in a disqualifying disposition within two years after the date of
the option grant or within one year after the shares are issued to the optionee, then (1)&nbsp;on the
sale of the shares, any amount realized in excess of the option price will be taxed to the optionee
as a long-term capital gain and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss, and (2)&nbsp;no
deduction will be allowed to the Company for federal income tax purposes. The exercise of an ISO
will give rise to an item of tax preference that may result in alternative tax liability for the
optionee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If shares of common stock acquired upon the exercise of an ISO are disposed of prior to the
expiration of either holding period described above, then generally (1)&nbsp;the optionee will realize
ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair
market value of the shares at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on the disposition of the
shares if a sale or exchange) over the option price paid for the shares, and (2)&nbsp;the Company will
be entitled to deduct the amount of income taxed to the optionee for federal income tax purposes if
the amount represents an ordinary and necessary business expense. Consequently, the Company
requires the optionee to notify us if there is a disposition prior to the expiration of either
holding period described above. Any further gain (or loss) realized by the optionee will be taxed
as short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss), as the case may be, and will not result in any
deduction by the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an ISO is exercised more than three months after termination of employment, the option will
be taxed in the same manner as the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, except when
termination of employment is due to death. In the case of termination as a result of death, if an
ISO is exercised more than one year after termination of employment, the option will be taxed in
the same manner as a non-qualified stock option. Different rules may apply if common stock is
purchased by an optionee who is also an officer or more than 10% shareholder. See &#147;Special Rules

the shares have been held. Different rules may apply if common stock is purchased by an optionee
who is also an officer or more than 10% shareholder. See &#147;Special Rules&nbsp;Applicable to Corporate
Insiders,&#148; below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Stock Appreciation Rights</B></u><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>.</B></FONT> With respect to stock appreciation rights (1)&nbsp;in
general, no income is realized by the grantee at the time the stock appreciation right is granted,
(2)&nbsp;generally, at exercise, the grantee will be required to include as ordinary income an amount
equal to the cash received and the fair market value of any shares of common stock received on the
exercise (payment by the grantee of the applicable withholding tax is required) and (3)&nbsp;the Company
may be entitled to a federal income tax deduction equal to the amount of income taxed to the
grantee. In addition, different income recognition rules may apply if common stock is received on
exercise by a grantee who is also an officer or more than 10% shareholder. See &#147;Special Rules
Applicable to Corporate Insiders,&#148; below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Restricted Stock Awards</B></u><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>.</B></FONT> With respect to restricted stock (1)&nbsp;in general, no
income is realized by the grantee at the time the restricted stock is granted and (2)&nbsp;when
restrictions on the restricted stock lapse, the grantee will be subject to tax at ordinary income
rates on the amount by which the fair market value of the restricted stock at such time exceeds the
amount (if any) paid for the stock by the grantee. However, a grantee may elect under Section
83(b) of the Code within 30&nbsp;days after the date of receipt of the restricted stock to be taxed
differently. In such a case (1)&nbsp;income is realized by the grantee at the time the restricted stock
is granted, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares of restricted
stock at such time (determined without regard to any restrictions which apply to the shares) over
the purchase price, if any, of the shares and (2)&nbsp;when the shares are sold, the grantee will
recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount realized on the
disposition and the basis of the restricted stock, which will equal the sum of the purchase price
and the amount included in gross income under Section&nbsp;83(b).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to a sale or exchange of the shares after the forfeiture period has expired, the
holding period to determine whether the grantee has long-term or short-term capital gain or loss
generally begins when the restrictions expire and the tax basis for such shares will generally be
based on the fair market value of such shares on such date (except that a Section 83(b) election
will cause the holding period commencement and the tax basis to be determined as of the date of
grant). The Company generally will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount that is taxable
as ordinary income to the grantee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Dividends on Restricted Stock</B></u><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>.</B></FONT> Dividends paid on restricted stock still
subject to forfeiture will generally be treated as compensation that is taxable as ordinary income
to the grantee and may be deductible by the Company. If the grantee elected to pay tax on the
stock at the time of the award, however, the dividends paid on the restricted stock are treated as
dividend income, which is taxable at a 15% rate to the grantee and not deductible by the Company.
If dividends are deferred with respect to restricted stock awards, then dividends will be taxed as
compensation at ordinary income rates when paid to the grantee and will generally be deductible by
the Company at that time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Restricted Stock Units</B></u><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>. </B></FONT>With respect to restricted stock units, the grantee
will generally recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to any cash received or the fair market
value of any shares of common stock received on the date of payment. The Company will be entitled
to a corresponding deduction.

grant of a performance award. Upon payment of the performance award, the grantee will recognize
ordinary income in an amount equal to the cash received or, if the performance award is payable in
common stock, the fair market value of the common stock received. When the grantee recognizes
ordinary income upon payment of a performance award, the Company will generally be entitled to a
tax deduction in the same amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Special Rules&nbsp;Applicable to Corporate Insiders</B></u><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>.</B></FONT> Generally, individuals
subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act (&#147;Insiders&#148;) are not taxed until six months after
exercise of a non-qualified stock option, with the excess of the fair market value of the shares of
common stock received upon exercise over the option purchase price, determined as of the end of the
six-month period, being taxed as ordinary income, and the holding period for treating any gain (or
loss) as long-term capital gain (or loss) beginning at the end of such period. (A similar rule
applies with respect to shares received upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights.) However,
an Insider who elects to be taxed under Section 83(b) of the Code should be taxed on the excess of
the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the option purchase price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Stock Swaps</B></u><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>. </B></FONT> The 2010 Plan provides that, with the Company&#146;s permission, an
optionee may transfer previously owned shares to the Company to satisfy the purchase price under an
option (a &#147;Stock Swap&#148;). Generally, if an optionee utilizes previously owned shares to purchase
shares upon the exercise of an ISO, the optionee will not realize any gain upon the exchange of the
old shares for the new shares and will carry over into the same number of new shares the basis and
holding period for the old shares. If the optionee purchases more shares than the number of old
shares surrendered in the Stock Swap, the incremental number of shares received in the Stock Swap
will have a basis of zero and a holding period beginning on the date of the exercise of the ISO.
If, however, shares acquired through the exercise of an ISO are used in a Stock Swap prior to the
end of the statutory holding period applicable to the old shares, the Stock Swap will constitute a
disqualifying disposition of the old shares, resulting in the immediate recognition of ordinary
income (see &#147;Incentive Stock Options,&#148; above).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Stock Swap is used to exercise a non-qualified stock option, the use of old shares to pay
the purchase price of an equal number of new shares generally will be tax-free to the optionee, and
he will carry over into the new shares the basis and holding period of the old shares. However, if
more shares are acquired than surrendered, the incremental shares received in the Stock Swap will
generally be taxed as compensation income in an amount equal to their fair market value at the time
of the Stock Swap. The optionee&#146;s basis in those additional shares will be their fair market value
taken into account in quantifying the optionee&#146;s compensation income and the holding period for
such shares will begin on the date of the Stock Swap.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><B>Capital Gains</B></u><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>.</B></FONT> Under current law, a taxpayer&#146;s net capital gain (i.e., the
amount by which the taxpayer&#146;s net long-term capital gains exceed his net short-term capital
losses) from a sale of shares is subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of 15% if the shares
have been held for more than 12&nbsp;months. Ordinary income is subject to tax at rates as high as 35%.
Capital losses are currently deductible against capital gains without limitation, but are
currently deductible against ordinary income in any year only to the extent of $3,000 ($1,500 in
the case of a married individual filing a separate return). Capital losses which are not currently
deductible by reason of the foregoing limitation may be carried forward to future years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>2010 Plan Benefits</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were approximately 185 officers, 300 other employees, 13 directors, and approximately
160 consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Because
the Committee has full discretion to determine who is an eligible employee (as defined in the 2010
Plan), there is no way to predict how many persons may ultimately receive awards or options under
the 2010 Plan or determine in advance the benefits or amounts that will be received in the future
by or allocated to specific persons or groups thereof under the 2010 Plan. No officers, other
employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Company have received awards or will receive
awards under the 2010 Plan before the date of the annual meeting of shareholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors established the Compensation Committee to, among other things,
establish, review and approve the compensation levels of Named Executive Officers, evaluate the
performance of Named Executive Officers and certain other officers and related matters for the
Company. The objectives and the goals of the Company&#146;s compensation program are to attract, retain,
motivate and reward executives capable of leading the Company in achieving its business objectives
and annual goals. The Company&#146;s program is intended to measure and reward past performance of the
Named Executive Officers and align their long-term interests with those of our shareholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee utilizes independent, qualified consultants to assist them in the
design and administration of the compensation programs applicable to Named Executive Officers and
others. From 2005 to date, the Compensation Committee has engaged Pearl, Meyer and Partners
(&#147;PM&#038;P&#148;) to assist them in such matters. The latest review of the Company&#146;s executive compensation
programs was conducted in 2007 with the assistance of PM&#038;P. The Committee utilized the latest
review to administer compensation programs for 2007 and 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 2009, in reaction to the then economic downturn and its negative effect on the
banking industry and the Company in particular, including the expectation that those negative
conditions would continue through at least the remainder of 2009, executive management recommended
to the Compensation Committee that base salaries of all Named Executive Officers and other
executives be reduced by 5% and all other officers salaries be frozen indefinitely. The
Compensation Committee accepted and implemented the proposal. The Compensation Committee also
decided to eliminate, for all officers, all incentive compensation programs and payments for 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After evaluating the experience, skills and efforts needed by executive management to lead the
Company during these difficult economic times, the Compensation Committee restored the 5% reduction
in base salary of executive officers and lifted the salary freeze of all other officers effective
January&nbsp;1, 2010. Further, the Compensation Committee restored to the Named Executive Officers, in
their 2010 compensation, the base salary forgone as a result of the 5% salary reduction in 2009.
The Compensation Committee has not yet determined the means to achieve the payment of these
amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incentive compensation programs which were eliminated have not been reinstated. Rather, the
Compensation Committee has engaged its consultant, PM&#038;P to assist them in developing new
compensation programs. The Compensation Committee has determined the new compensation programs
must achieve the objectives described in the section &#147;Objectives of Hudson Valley Holding Corp.&#146;s
Compensation Programs&#148; below. As a preliminary step, the Compensation Committee proposed to the
Board of Directors the Hudson Valley Holding Corp. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which shareholders
are being asked to vote upon at this annual meeting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these actions, there were no incentive compensation programs in effect for the
Company or its Named Executive Officers during 2009, and no incentive payments or awards were made
during 2009. Currently, the specific compensation programs for 2010 and beyond are being considered
by the Compensation Committee.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, our executive compensation programs were designed to reward the achievement of
specific annual, short-term and long-term goals by the Company. Performance-based metrics were
adopted annually and used to determine achievement of goals by the Named Executive Officers. These
performance-based metrics included financial and non-financial metrics. Examples of
performance-based metrics utilized in years prior to 2009 included return on average shareholders&#146;
equity, increase in loans and deposits, increase in fee income and expansion of the Company&#146;s
branch banking network.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee currently anticipates the new compensation programs under

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM&#038;P is currently assisting the Compensation Committee with developing a new compensation
program which will be implemented for 2010. The Compensation Committee intends the compensation
program to accomplish the objectives discussed under the section &#147;Objectives of Hudson Valley
Holding Corp.&#146;s Compensation Programs&#148; above. The Compensation Committee believes that given the
recent changes in banking regulations, the effect of the economic recession on the economy in
general and the banking industry in particular, the resulting termination in early 2009 by the
Company of all incentive compensation programs, as well as requirements from the SEC, a complete
review of the Company&#146;s compensation programs is appropriate. A focus of the new compensation
programs will be on incentive compensation, and to ensure that our compensation programs do not
encourage excessive risk taking.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Review of Named Executive Officer Performance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year the Compensation Committee reviews each compensation element of the Named Executive
Officers. In each case, we take into account the scope of responsibilities and experience, and
balance them against competitive salary levels. Members of the Compensation Committee have the
opportunity to interact with the Named Executive Officers at various times during the year, which
allows the Compensation Committee to form its own assessment of each individual&#146;s performance.
This interaction is further supplemented by input from the Board which also regularly interacts
with the Named Executive Officers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year the Chief Executive Officer (the &#147;CEO&#148;) presents to the Compensation Committee his
evaluation of each Named Executive Officer, which includes a review of contribution and performance
over the past year, strengths, weaknesses, development plans and succession potential. Following
this presentation, and a review of the performance-based metrics, the Compensation Committee makes
its own assessments and determines the compensation for each Named Executive Officer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Compensation Committee reviews the performance of the CEO relative to
achievement of individual and Company performance-based metrics. Following such review the
Compensation Committee makes its own assessment and determines the compensation for the CEO.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2009, the Compensation Committee&#146;s assessment of performance for each Named Executive
Officer, including the CEO, was not based upon achievement of performance-based metrics. Rather,
the Compensation Committee considered the challenging economic environment affecting the banking
industry and the Company, and the experience, skills and effort needed by each Named Executive
Officer to lead the Company during 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Base Salaries</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation Committee utilized a 2007 review of the Company&#146;s compensation programs by
PM&#038;P to establish base salaries of each Named Executive Officer for 2007 and 2008. This review
included PM&#038;P providing comparative market data on compensation practices and programs based on an
analysis of banking and general industry surveys. The Compensation Committee also considered the
Company&#146;s performance as measured by achievement of performance-based metrics by each Named
Executive Officer.

$1,000,000 on the amount of compensation that may be deducted by the Company in any year with
respect to the CEO or any other Named Executive Officer unless the compensation is
performance-based compensation as described in Section 162(m) and the related regulations. We have
qualified certain compensation paid to Named Executive Officers for deductibility under Section
162(m), including (i)&nbsp;certain amounts paid as incentive compensation, and (ii)&nbsp;certain compensation
expense related to options granted pursuant to the Company&#146;s 2002 Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have generally attempted to structure executive compensation so as to preserve
deductibility, we also believe that there may be circumstances where our interests are best served
by maintaining flexibility in the way compensation is provided, even if it may result in the
non-deductibility of certain compensation under the Code.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer a variety of health and welfare programs to all eligible employees. The Named
Executive Officers generally are eligible for the same benefit programs on the same basis as the
rest of the eligible employees. The health and welfare programs are intended to protect employees
against catastrophic loss and encourage a healthy lifestyle. Our health and welfare programs
include medical, pharmaceutical, dental, life insurance and accidental death and disability. The
Company provides full time employees, regularly scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week,
short-term disability, long-term disability and life insurance. All employees, including Named
Executive Officers, contribute to the cost of these plans. We offer a qualified 401(k) savings
and profit sharing retirement plan. All Company employees, including Named Executive Officers, are
generally eligible for this plan. The Compensation Committee determines the contribution to the
profit sharing plan and the 401(k) matching contribution annually as reflected in the All Other
Compensation Table on page 31.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits to Named Executive Officers and certain
other officers. These benefits are provided through both the 1995 Supplemental Retirement Plan and
the 1997 Supplemental Retirement Plan (collectively the &#147;SERP&#148;). These plans are not qualified for
tax purposes and are available only to certain officers. Benefits under these plans are unfunded.
The SERP entitles participating officers to receive supplemental retirement benefits for a period
of 15&nbsp;years payable on a monthly basis. The Company believes providing this benefit is important
to remain competitive with companies within the industry, to provide a competitive level of
retirement income, and to help assure orderly management succession by encouraging continued
employment.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, the Compensation Committee proposed changes to certain provisions of the SERP for
Named Executive Officers. These changes included: extending the normal retirement date for Messrs.
Palaia and Skuthan to anytime between age 65 and age 70; capping the qualified annual base salary
under the SERP for Messrs.&nbsp;Landy, Brown and Maloney at $400,000, and; extending the normal
retirement date for Messrs.&nbsp;Landy, Brown and Maloney to anytime between age 60 and age 70 with a
minimum of 20&nbsp;years of service. These changes were intended to reduce the cost of the SERP to the
Company. The Named Executive Officers each accepted these changes reducing the projected SERP
benefits upon retirement to Messrs.&nbsp;Landy, Brown and Maloney by between approximately $1.5&nbsp;million
and $2.7&nbsp;million each and, as a result, reduced the Company&#146;s projected cost of providing this
benefit by approximately $6&nbsp;million. Despite the significant reduction in projected SERP benefits,
the Summary Compensation Table on page 30 reflects an increase in the Pension Value due to the
method of accounting for the accumulated benefit obligation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Named Executive Officer is provided certain additional benefits which includes the use of
a company-owned automobile. The automobile facilitates Named Executive Officers&#146; travel between our
offices, to business meetings with customers and vendors. Named Executive Officers may use the
automobile for personal transportation. Personal use of the automobile results in taxable income to
the Named Executive Officer, and we include this in the amounts of income we report to the Named
Executive Officers and the Internal Revenue Service. We also support and encourage certain Named
Executive Officers to hold a membership in one local country club for which we pay dues and other
business related expenses. We find that the club membership is an effective means of obtaining
business as it allows Named Executive Officers to interact with present and prospective customers
in a relaxed, informal environment. We require that any personal use of the country club facilities
be paid directly by the Named Executive Officers. Because the club memberships are used at our
expense only for business entertainment, we do not include them as benefits in the Summary

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company makes available to its Named Executive Officers a qualified 401(k) and profit
sharing retirement plan, which is available to all employees on the same terms and conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides supplemental retirement benefits to certain Named Executive Officers and
other officers. These benefits are provided through both the 1995 Supplemental Retirement Plan and
the 1997 Supplemental Retirement Plan (collectively the &#147;SERP&#148;). These plans are not qualified for
tax purposes and are available only to certain officers. Benefits under these plans are unfunded.
The SERP entitles participating officers to receive supplemental retirement benefits for a period
of 15&nbsp;years payable on a monthly basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Named Executive Officers, Messrs.&nbsp;Landy and Palaia are participants in the 1995
Supplemental Retirement Plan, Messrs.&nbsp;Brown, Maloney and Skuthan are participants in the 1997
Supplemental Retirement Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the 1995 Supplemental Retirement Plan, supplemental benefits equal 75% of the
Named Executive Officer&#146;s highest base salary in any of the last three years of employment, less
any retirement plan benefits provided to him by the Company. Pursuant to the 1997 Supplemental
Retirement Plan, supplemental benefits equal 65% of the average of the highest five years&#146; annual
salary paid to the Named Executive Officer during his last 10&nbsp;years of employment, reduced by (1)
the value of his qualified plan account as of the date of retirement; (2)&nbsp;the value of his 401(k)
matching benefit as of the date of retirement; (3)&nbsp;50% of his primary social security benefit; and
(4)&nbsp;the value of any other retirement type benefits provided to him by the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the SERP, the participants receive supplemental retirement benefits determined as
described above. Under the SERP the normal retirement date is defined as follows: for Messrs.
Landy, Brown and Maloney, anytime between the attainment of age 60 and age 70 with a minimum of 20
years service; for Messrs.&nbsp;Palaia and Skuthan, anytime between the attainment of age 65 and age 70.
No benefits vest to the participant prior to the normal retirement date except at death or
disability as defined in the SERP. Certain benefits maybe received based upon a change in control
as described in &#147;Disclosure Regarding Termination and Change in Control Provisions &#151; Potential
Payments upon Termination or Change in Control&#148; on page 34. The SERP does not provide for early
retirement nor for the crediting of extra years of service. The Company believes providing this
benefit is important to remain competitive with companies within the industry, to provide a
competitive level of retirement income, and to help assure orderly management succession by
encouraging continued employment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009 the Compensation Committee proposed changes to certain provisions of the SERP for
Named Executive Officers. These changes included: extending the normal retirement date for Messrs.
Palaia and Skuthan to anytime between age 65 and age 70; capping the qualified annual base salary

for Messrs.&nbsp;Landy, Brown and Maloney to anytime between age 60 and age 70 with a minimum of 20
years of service. These changes were intended to reduce the cost of the SERP to the Company. The
Named Executive Officers each accepted these changes reducing the projected SERP benefit upon
retirement to Messrs.&nbsp;Landy, Brown and Maloney by between approximately $1.5&nbsp;million and $2.7
million each and, as a result, reduced the Company&#146;s projected cost of providing this benefit by
approximately $6&nbsp;million. Despite the significant reduction in projected SERP benefits, the Summary
Compensation Table on page 30 reflects an increase in the Pension Value due to the method of
accounting for the accumulated benefit obligation.

members of the Board. Employee directors Messrs.&nbsp;Landy, Brown and Maloney do not receive

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the listing of the Company&#146;s common stock on NASDAQ on September&nbsp;21, 2009, the
Company&#146;s common stock traded sporadically on the OTC Bulletin Board. The Company historically
maintained a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the Company offered to repurchase shares of
common stock from any shareholder based on the appraised value of the Company. A significant
percentage of the Company&#146;s shares of common stock were also subject to transfer restrictions
imposed by Stock Restriction Agreements entered into by many of the Company&#146;s shareholders. The
Company required all employees, directors and others who acquired shares of common stock from the
Company to enter into Stock Restriction Agreements that gave the Company a right of first refusal
on any shares of common stock that the shareholder wished to transfer. Gifts to family members were
generally not subject to the Company&#146;s right of first refusal, but the donee was required to enter
into a Stock Restriction Agreement with the Company. Pursuant to the Stock Restriction Agreements,
the Company had the discretion, but was not required, to purchase all of the shares offered upon
the same terms and conditions as that offered by the prospective purchaser. The table below sets
forth the aggregate number of shares and aggregate purchase price for shares purchased by the
Company from executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of five percent or more of the
common stock (considered together with members of their immediate family) pursuant to Stock
Restriction Agreements in 2009. The table excludes data for each executive officer, director and
beneficial owner whose sales to the Company aggregated less than $120,000 in 2009.

accompanied by payment therefore, as well as for any required tax withholding, and otherwise in
accordance with the Agreement pursuant to which the Option was granted. The purchase price and
required tax withholding for any shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall be
paid in full upon such exercise (i)&nbsp;in cash, (ii)&nbsp;by check, (iii)&nbsp;at the discretion of the
Committee, by transferring Shares having a Fair Market Value on the day preceding the date of
exercise of such option equal to the aggregate purchase price for the Shares being purchased to the
Company and satisfying such other terms and conditions as may be imposed by the Committee; provided
that such Shares have been held by the Optionee for no less than six months (or such other period
as established from time to time by the Committee or generally accepted accounting principles),
(iv)&nbsp;at the discretion of the Committee, subject to such other terms and conditions as may be
imposed by the Committee, by having Shares that would otherwise have been delivered to the Optionee
upon exercise of an Option withheld by the Company, or (v)&nbsp;such other method as approved by the
Committee at the discretion of the Committee. If requested by the Committee, the Optionee shall
deliver the Agreement evidencing the Option and the Agreement evidencing any related Stock
Appreciation Right to the Secretary of the Company who shall endorse thereon a notation of such
exercise and return such Agreement to the Optionee. Not less than 100 Shares may be purchased at

interest in such Subsidiary), and also including the voluntary resignation of the Optionee (at a
time when Cause does not exist), the Option (to the extent exercisable at the time of the

exercise and return such Agreements to the Grantee.

date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right or, alternatively, at the sole discretion of the
Committee, solely in cash, or in a combination of cash and Shares as the Committee deems advisable.
In the event that a Stock Appreciation Right is exercised within the sixty-day period following a
Change in Control, any amount payable shall be solely in cash. If the Committee decides to make
full payment in Shares, and the amount payable results in a fractional Share, payment for the
fractional Share will be made in cash.

or reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with such Performance
Awards, but to the extent required by Section 162(m) may not exercise discretion to increase
any such amount payable to a covered employee in respect of a Performance Award subject to
