(Holdings) Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) include this cautionary statement regarding
forward-looking statements for the express purpose of using protections of the safe-harbor provided
by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to all such forward-looking
statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (a)
projections of revenues, capital expenditures, growth, prospects, dividends, capital structure and
other financial matters; (b)&nbsp;statements of plans and objectives of the Company or its management or
board of directors; (c)&nbsp;statements of future economic performance; (d)&nbsp;statements of assumptions
underlying other statements and statements about the Company and its business relating to the
future; and (e)&nbsp;any statements using the words &#147;anticipate&#148;, &#147;expect&#148;, &#147;may&#148;, &#147;project&#148;, &#147;intend&#148;,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s ability to predict projected results or the effect of certain events on the Company&#146;s
operating results is inherently uncertain. Therefore, the Company wishes to caution each reader of
this Quarterly Report to carefully consider the risk factors stated in the Company&#146;s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, any or all of which have in the past and
could in the future affect the ability of the Company to achieve its anticipated results and could
cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein, including, but not limited
to: effects of current economic crisis, ability to attract and retain customers to purchase its
products, ability to develop or launch new software products, technological advances by third
parties and competition, ability to protect the Company&#146;s patented technology, and ability to
obtain settlements in connection with its patent enforcement activities. You should not place
any undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any intent or
obligations to update forward-looking statements contained in this

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has available a revolving loan facility with National City Bank (&#147;NCB&#148;) equal to the
lesser of (a) $3,000,000, (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and 90%
of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable or (c)&nbsp;four times the sum of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve month period. Outstanding
borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% payable monthly which
amounted to 3.02% as of March&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company also must pay an unused revolving loan
commitment fee of 0.25% of the average daily amount by which the revolving loan commitment exceeds
the outstanding principal amount. The amount paid on the unused revolving loan commitment fee
amounted to $1,697 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009. The revolving loan expires on
December&nbsp;30, 2010. All borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company.
The outstanding balance on the revolving loan was $561,000 at March&nbsp;31, 2009. Available for
borrowing under the revolving loan on March&nbsp;31, 2009 was $950,905. The carrying amount of
receivables that served as collateral for borrowings totaled $1,511,905 at March&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company entered into a second modification of the loan documents with NCB
(the &#147;Second Modification&#148;). The Second Modification reduced the acquisition loan from $2,600,000
to $500,000 (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;). The Acquisition Loan expires on December&nbsp;21, 2009, unless
extended. All borrowings under the Acquisition Loan are collateralized by substantially all assets
of the Company. The Acquisition Loan was secured by a letter of credit from SEB Bank to NCB.
Under the Second Modification, NCB removed the provision in the Loan Agreement requiring that the
Company obtain a letter of credit as security for the Acquisition Loan. Pursuant to the terms of
the Second Modification, NCB executed a notice of termination and release of the Letter of Credit
dated November&nbsp;18, 2008. Borrowings under the Acquisition Loan bear interest (2.52% at March&nbsp;31,
2009) at LIBOR plus 2.00% payable monthly. The outstanding balances on the Acquisition Loan and
the Acquisition Loan were $500,000 and $2,600,000 at March&nbsp;31, 2009 and March&nbsp;31, 2008,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The revolving loan facility and Acquisition Loan (the &#147;Loan Agreements&#148;) were secured by a
guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands
company. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009, Fairford beneficially owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s outstanding
Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and
director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole beneficiary of a
revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of the Company, is
the director of Fairford.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Borrowings under the Loan Agreements are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on
indebtedness, encumbrances, investments, business combinations, and other related items. As of
March&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. The more significant covenants
under the Loan Agreements, include that, without NCB&#146;s prior written consent, the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to: (i)&nbsp;incur or have outstanding any
indebtedness in excess of $20,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate; (ii)&nbsp;dispose of all,
or any part, of business or assets; (iii)&nbsp;make any acquisitions, or (iv)&nbsp;issue any additional
shares of stock or other securities and the Company shall not issue more than 10% of the Company&#146;s
capital stock pursuant to its stock option plan on a fully-diluted basis.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>NOTE 4: New Accounting Pronouncements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Statement No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair
Value Measurements </I>(&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement
establishes a fair value hierarchy about the assumptions used to measure fair value and clarifies
assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset. The
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February&nbsp;2008, the
FASB issued Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) 157-2, <I>Effective Date of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157 </I>(&#147;FSP 157-2&#148;).
This FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at
least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The adoption of SFAS 157 had no material effect on the Company&#146;s financial
statements. In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;157-3, <I>Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When the Market for that Asset is Not Active </I>(&#147;FSP 157-3&#148;), which clarifies the
application of SFAS 157 in an inactive market. FSP 157-3 explains that when relevant and observable
market information is not available to determine the measurement of an asset&#146;s fair value,
management must use their judgment about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing
the asset in a current sale transaction. Appropriate risk adjustments that a market participant
would use must also be taken into account when determining the fair value. Application of this
guidance should be accounted for as a change in estimate and FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance.
Upon adoption of FSP 157-3, there was no material impact on the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated
financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2009, the FASB released Proposed Staff Position SFAS 157-e, &#147;<I>Determining Whether a Market
Is Not Active and a Transaction Is Not Distressed</I>&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157-e&#148;). This proposal provides
additional guidance in determining whether a market for a financial asset is not active and a
transaction is not distressed for fair value measurement purposes as defined in SFAS 157. SFAS
157-e is effective for interim periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009, but early adoption is permitted
for interim periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS
157-e during the second quarter of 2009, but does not believe this guidance will have a significant
impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;115-2 and No.&nbsp;124-2, &#147;<I>Recognition and Presentation of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments&#148;, </I>which amends existing guidance for determining whether
impairment is other-than-temporary for debt securities. The FSP requires an entity to assess
whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a
security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of
these criteria is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in
earnings. For securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment
recognized in earnings is limited to the amount related to credit losses, while impairment related
to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Additionally, this FSP expands and
increases the frequency of existing disclosures about other-than-temporary impairments for debt and
equity securities. This FSP is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after
June&nbsp;15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company
plans to adopt this FSP in the second quarter, however, does not expect the adoption to have a
material effect on the results of operations or financial position
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;157-4, &#147;<I>Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of
Activity for the Asset and Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That
Are Not Orderly&#148;</I>. This FSP emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the
volume and level of activity, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same. Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market
participants. The FSP provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there has
been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in
relation to normal market activity. In addition, when transactions or quoted prices are not
considered orderly, adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be
needed to determine the appropriate fair value. The FSP also requires increased disclosures. This
FSP is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009, and shall be
applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The
Company plans to adopt this FSP in the second quarter, however, does not expect the adoption to
have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;107-1 and APB 28-1, &#147;<I>Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments&#148;</I>. This FSP amends FASB Statement No.&nbsp;107, <I>Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments</I>, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim
reporting periods of publicly traded companies that were previously only required in annual
financial statements. This FSP is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June&nbsp;15,
2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company plans to
adopt this FSP in the second quarter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) provides for
the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase, and restricted stock grants
of, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Individuals eligible for participation in the
Plan include designated officers and other employees (including employees who also serve as
directors), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants who perform services
for the Company. The terms of each grant under the Plan are determined by the Board of Directors,
or a committee of the board administering the Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a change of control of the Company as
in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Stock options granted under the Plan typically become
exercisable over a one to five year period. Generally, the options have various vesting periods,
which include immediate and term vesting periods.

grants will be granted under the Plan. Grants that were made under the Plan prior to stockholders&#146;
approval of the Stock Incentive Plan will continue to be administered under the Plan. On May&nbsp;28,
2008, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock authorized for issuance pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan from 3,000,000 shares to
6,000,000 shares.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee is authorized to grant awards to
non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees of, and consultants and advisors to,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and to determine the number and types of such awards and the
terms, conditions, vesting and other limitations applicable to each such award. In addition, the
Compensation Committee has the power to interpret the Stock Incentive Plan and to adopt such rules

Incentive Plan.

specified events. Such shares may be treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares. As of
March&nbsp;31, 2009, there were 3,053,468 awards available for grant under the Stock Incentive Plan. If
any outstanding award is cancelled, forfeited, or surrendered to the Company, shares of Class&nbsp;A

Plan. Incentive stock options may be granted only to participants who are executive officers and
other employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the day of the grant, and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form option
valuation model (Black-Scholes-Merton formula) that uses the assumptions noted in the foregoing
table. Because closed-form valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those
ranges are disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from historical
volatility of the Company&#146;s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and
employee termination within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar
historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of
options granted is derived from general practices used by other companies in the software industry
and estimates by the Company of the period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

31, 2009, the Company did not experience any material losses related to these indemnification
obligations and no material claims with respect thereto were outstanding. The Company does not
expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and consequently, the
Company has not established any related accruals.

implementation of FIN 48, there was no cumulative effect adjustment for unrecognized tax benefits,
which would have been accounted for as an adjustment to the January&nbsp;1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009 and March&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company had $52,555 and $25,670 of

income tax as well as income tax of the state of Indiana and foreign income tax in the United
Kingdom. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Item&nbsp;2. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagement (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute the software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications expenses while reducing
the resource investment required to process, validate, approve, and pay their telecommunication
invoices. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, and data usage, record and monitor communications,
and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back.
These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade products. Customers
typically purchase these products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications
platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection, enforcement and defense of the
Company&#146;s intellectual property, including patents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates its revenues and cash from several sources: software sales, license fees,
processing fees, implementation fees, training and consulting services, and enforcement revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s software products and services are subject to changing technology and evolving
customer needs which require the Company to continually invest in research and development in order
to respond to such demands. The limited financial resources available to the Company require the
Company to concentrate on those business segments and product lines which provide the greatest
returns on investment. The EIM segment, as compared to the other business segments, provides the
predominant share of income from operations and cash flow from operations. The majority of
Telemanagement segment revenues are derived from its United Kingdom operations. The VoIP segment
is a relatively new segment which the Company believes offers growth opportunity; however, there
can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in the VoIP market. The Company believes
it is able to develop and market its VoIP products with its current resources and will not need to
incur incremental costs to support this segment. The Company reported revenue in the EIM segment
of $2.9&nbsp;million and $3.9&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
For the Telemanagement segment, the Company recorded revenues of $1.0&nbsp;million and $1.4&nbsp;million for
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Patent Enforcement segment
recorded revenue of $0 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008. Revenue of $72 thousand
and $29 thousand was recognized for the VoIP segment in the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that as voice and data services continue to commoditize, service providers are
seeking alternative business models to replace revenue lost directly as a result of pricing
pressures. One such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted voice services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice services would purchase enabling
communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate the
associated capital expense over time. The Company believes that this approach had two major
disadvantages for such organizations. The first being that organizations would experience
significant capital and operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The
second being that the capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice
service technology evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice features while
reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and revenue per user advantage possible by delivering such managed and
hosted service offerings that do not require expensive equipment, providers not only look at
acquiring new customers but converting legacy customers onto the NGN platform. The Company
believes that this conversion process is significant. Many legacy features and functions are not
available on NGN platforms, primarily due to the immaturity of the service delivery model.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications help eliminate customer resistance to conversion to the next
generation platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the
delivery of compelling value added services. The Company is marketing its two VoIP applications,
emPulse, a web-based communications traffic analysis solution, and SmartRecord<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP, which enables
service providers to selectively intercept communications on behalf of their hosted and managed
service customers. These applications also enable managed and hosted service customers of service
providers to analyze voice and data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform
administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back. These
applications were released as enterprise-grade products in the first quarter of 2007. Although no
assurances can be made, the Company anticipates that customers will purchase these products when
upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The Company has taken the business
benefits of these enterprise-grade applications and has delivered provider-grade managed and hosted
service applications, enabling service providers to create a new recurring revenue stream, while
ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools necessary and relevant to their particular line
of business.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company experienced a change in its financial
condition as a result of a net loss of $522,691. The change was primarily attributable to a drop
in revenue in the United Kingdom of $1,269,571 which was primarily attributable to the weakening of
the UK pound against the US dollar.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At March&nbsp;31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents were $299,032 compared to $341,936 at December&nbsp;31,
2008, and such decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in operating and investing
activities offset by cash provided by investing activities. Cash used in the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2009 by operating activities amounted to $365,539 which was primarily related to the net
operating loss of $522,691 partially off-set by $367,060 of non-cash depreciation and amortization.
Cash provided by financing activities related to net borrowings of $561,000 under the Company&#146;s
Revolving Loan during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009. Cash utilized in investing activities
of $192,666 related to additions to property, equipment and software. The Company realized an
increase in net current assets (current assets less current liabilities) of $179,980 which was
primarily attributable to the increase in receivables and a decrease in accrued wages and other
compensation. The Company realized a decline in stockholders&#146; equity of $457,577 primarily as a
result of the net loss reported for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company generates
approximately 73% of its revenues from operations in the United Kingdom where the functional
currency, the UK pound, has deteriorated by 2.2% in relation to the US dollar in the three months
ended March&nbsp;31, 2009.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from operations for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 decreased $1,389,924, or 26.0%,
to $3,949,288 as compared to $5,339,212 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008. The decrease in
revenue was primarily due to the $1,269,571, or 30.7% decrease of revenue derived from the UK
operations associated with a 28.1% drop in the UK pound to US dollar average exchange rate for the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to the average exchange rate for the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2008. Revenues derived from the UK operations represent 72.6% and 77.5% of total
revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The US revenues
decreased by $120,353, or 10.0%, to $1,083,490 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 compared
to $1,203,843 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008. The decrease in US revenues was primarily
related to a decrease in the revenue recognized from the largest EIM customer in the United States
due to decreased processing for that customer. The Company earns a substantial portion of its
revenue from a single EIM customer. This customer represented 19.4% of the total revenues for the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 16.8% for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008. The
increase in the percentage in the largest customer was primarily the result of a decrease in total
revenue due to the weakening of the UK pound against the US dollar. The Company believes that the
portion of revenue from the single largest EIM customer will decline due to the erosion of the
customer&#146;s customer base while the revenue from its second largest customer will remain consistent
with prior periods.

months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the lower exchange rate of the UK
pound to the US dollar. For software sales, service fee and license fee revenues, the cost of
products and services, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 28.6% of revenue for the three
months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 as compared to 22.6% of revenue for the three months ended March&nbsp;31,

indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When such events occur,
the Company compares the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected future cash

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Reserves. </I>The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policy is
consistent with the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, Revenue Recognition (&#147;SAB
104&#148;) which supersedes SAB No.&nbsp;101, &#147;Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.&#148; SAB No.&nbsp;104
primarily rescinds the accounting guidance contained in SAB No.&nbsp;101 related to multiple-element
revenue arrangements, which was superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;00-21,
&#147;Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.&#148; Additionally, SAB No.&nbsp;104
rescinds the SEC&#146;s &#147;Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, Statement of Position No.&nbsp;97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition (&#147;SOP 97-2&#148;), and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and
interpretations. In general, the Company records revenue when it is realized, or realizable, and
earned. Revenues from software licenses are recognized upon shipment, delivery or customer
acceptance, based on the substance of the arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided
there are no significant remaining vendor obligations to be fulfilled and collectability is
reasonably assured. Software sales revenue is generated from licensing software to new customers
and from licensing additional users and new applications to existing customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in SOP 97-2. Support and maintenance
revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Revenues from
processing, training, consulting, and customization are recognized as provided to customers. If
the services are essential to the functionality of the software, revenue from the software
component is deferred until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth in paragraph 65 of
SOP 97-2. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the entire arrangement is accounted
for in conformity with Accounting Research Bulletin (&#147;ARB&#148;) No.&nbsp;45, using the relevant guidance in
SOP 81-1. The Company carefully evaluates the circumstances surrounding the implementations to
determine whether the percentage-of-completion method or the completed-contract method should be
used. Most implementations relate to the Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in
less than 30&nbsp;days once the work begins. The Company uses the completed-contract method on
contracts that will be completed within 30&nbsp;days since it produces a result similar to the
percentage-of-completion method. On contracts that will take over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company
uses the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company continuously monitors collections
and payments from its customers and the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that the Company has identified. If the
financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Where an allowance for doubtful
accounts has been established with respect to customer receivables, as payments are made on such
receivables or if the customer goes out of business with no chance of collection, the allowances
will decrease with a corresponding adjustment to accounts receivable as deemed appropriate.

Value Measurements </I>(&#147;SFAS 157&#148;). This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement
establishes a fair value hierarchy about the assumptions used to measure fair value and clarifies
assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset. The
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February&nbsp;2008, the
FASB issued Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) 157-2, <I>Effective Date of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157 </I>(&#147;FSP 157-2&#148;).
This FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at
least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The adoption of SFAS 157 had no material effect on the Company&#146;s financial
statements. In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;157-3, <I>Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When the Market for that Asset is Not Active </I>(&#147;FSP 157-3&#148;), which clarifies the
application of SFAS 157 in an inactive market. FSP 157-3 explains that when relevant and observable
market information is not available to determine the measurement of an asset&#146;s fair value,
management must use their judgment about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing
the asset in a current sale transaction. Appropriate risk adjustments that a market participant
would use must also be taken into account when determining the fair value. Application of this
guidance should be accounted for as a change in estimate and FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance.
Upon adoption of FSP 157-3, there was no material impact on the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated
financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2009, the FASB released Proposed Staff Position SFAS 157-e, &#147;<I>Determining Whether a Market
Is Not Active and a Transaction Is Not Distressed</I>&#148; (&#147;SFAS 157-e&#148;). This proposal provides
additional guidance in determining whether a market for a financial asset is not active and a
transaction is not distressed for fair value measurement purposes as defined in SFAS 157. SFAS
157-e is effective for interim periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009, but early adoption is permitted

impairment is other-than-temporary for debt securities. The FSP requires an entity to assess

security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of
these criteria is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in

volume and level of activity, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same. Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market
participants. The FSP provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there has
been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in
relation to normal market activity. In addition, when transactions or quoted prices are not
considered orderly, adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be
needed to determine the appropriate fair value. The FSP also requires increased disclosures. This

Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching a reasonable level
of assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the

to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (&#147;Internal Control&#148;) to determine whether
any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have
materially affected or which are reasonably likely to materially affect Internal Control. Based on
that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary its
procedures and controls.
