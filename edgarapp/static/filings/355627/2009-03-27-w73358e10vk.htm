<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">EIM designs, develops and provides electronic invoice presentment, analysis and payment software
that enables Internet-based customer self-care for wireline, wireless and convergent providers of
telecommunications services. EIM software and services are used primarily by telecommunications
services providers to enhance their customer relationships while reducing the providers&#146;
operational expenses related to paper-based invoice delivery and customer support relating to
billing inquiries. Using the Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers
are able to electronically invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the
enterprise customers to improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications
expenses while reducing the resource investment required to process, validate, approve, and pay
their telecommunication invoices. The Company has historically marketed its EIM products and
services in North America directly to telecommunication service providers who then market and
distribute the product to their enterprise customers, which consist primarily of businesses,
government agencies and institutions. The Company actively markets EIM products and services in
both North America and Europe.

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Competition and integration continue to reshape the communications industry. Continued downward
pressure on prices is driven by strong competition, the increasing replacement of wireline services
with wireless alternatives, the introduction of new technologies based on internet protocol (&#147;IP&#148;)
including VoIP, video, and merger and acquisition activities of key service providers. As a
result of such pricing pressures, the Company has been required to reduce its pricing and achieve
product revenue growth through increased volume sales or processing of call detail records.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The industry dynamics noted above are expected to present opportunities for the Company&#146;s software
and service offerings. As service provider margins decline, the Company believes that it continues
to deliver a value message that demonstrates how its EIM and Telemanagement solutions create
competitive differentiation, stronger customer relationships, enhanced lifetime value and increased
operational efficiencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following market drivers are consistent across the telecommunications industry segments
targeted by the Company. Each of these drivers is expected to positively impact the Company&#146;s
growth strategies and the Company&#146;s strategic business positioning. The following trends are
concurrent and are predicted to enhance the growing demand for the enhanced invoice delivery,
processing and payment capabilities provided by the Company&#146;s SmartBill<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> product suite.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Convergence and Complexity. </I>The nature, size, needs and complexity of the telecommunications
industry continue to change. Consolidation and service expansion continue to narrow the playing
field in the Tier 1 service provider segment that includes Verizon Communications, Inc., Sprint
Corp/Nextel Communications, Inc. and AT&#038;T Inc. Opportunity exists within the Tier 1 segment but is
not the primary focus of the Company. Broad opportunities exist in the smaller Tier 2, 3 and 4
market segments that include the regional, niche, and smaller markets. Expanded/bundled service
offerings (local and long distance, voice and data, wireline and wireless, broadband DSL and
cable-based access) are valued by end customers but add significant complexity to the
customer/provider relationship. The industry has evolved around the Integrated Communications
Provider (&#147;ICP&#148;) model. Many service providers are achieving or have developed their ICP model via
acquisition and third-party resale. The Company&#146;s EIM and Telemanagement software and services
enable the ICPs to deliver a viable, integrated and converged experience to their customers &#151; even
if the providers&#146; internal systems and infrastructure may not yet support such integration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Customer Relationship Management. </I>The Internet continues to redefine the relationship between
service providers and their customers. The industry has invested significant capital in an attempt
to streamline its interaction with customers and prospects alike. Service providers and industry
analysts view web-enabled customer self-care as the key to reducing costs by transitioning many
service and support functions directly to customers. A provider who successfully migrates customer
support functions onto the Web and into the hands of the customer consistently drives down costs,
drives up profits and increases customer satisfaction by enabling the customer to save time,
enhance convenience, and create the customer&#146;s own &#147;personalized&#148; user experience. Adoption and
use of the tools extended by service providers has been disappointing. By delivering a compelling
process and cost advantage to enterprise customers, the Company believes it can drive adoption and
improve the return on investment for service providers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Customer Ownership. </I>Managing the life cycle and maximizing the return from, and retention of,
customers are increasingly recognized to be more important than to simply focus on acquiring more
customers. In an industry experiencing increased acquisition costs, accelerating customer
turnover, and declining margins, it is vital to focus on retention and revenue per customer.
Service providers are seeking options enabling competitive differentiation in service delivery,
product bundling and customer self-care. The Company&#146;s electronic invoice presentment and payment
platform strengthens the service provider&#146;s competitive position while optimizing key operational
costs involving customer care and paper billing fulfillment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Outsource/Service Bureau. </I>The providers in the telecommunications industry today are demonstrating
increasing interest in establishing third party relationships that add value to their product
portfolio while allowing the provider to focus on its core competencies. The
outsourcing/Application Service Provider (&#147;ASP&#148;) delivery model represents an alternative to the
risks and costs associated with rapidly changing technologies. Service providers are migrating
from in-house development to packaged vendor solutions. At no time in their history has
competition been so prevalent and the need to extend service portfolios so important. Companies
are seeking rapid systems acquisition and implementation from outside parties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Single Vendor Relationships. </I>As competition continues to intensify across virtually every
communications segment, carriers and service providers are looking to their billing and customer
management infrastructure as one of the key differentiators. The industry is moving toward vendor
relationships that can offer integrated solutions. Critical to this requirement are speed of
implementation, scalability, modularity, and seamless integration with other critical business
support systems. As the global telecommunications market continues to evolve, end customers will
be drawn to service providers who not only offer a broad array of services but who will enable them
to see all telecommunication expenditures from a single point of contact (&#147;360&#186; Visibility&#148;).
Whether established incumbents or new market entrants, telecommunications providers require systems
that allow all services to be bundled together into value plans that encourage customer retention
and adoption of additional services. Furthermore, providers require customer management systems
that enable increasingly complex customer relationships to be managed through a unified,
user-friendly interface into the customer database.

efficiently manage their relationships with customers. CTI&#146;s software and services are designed to
permit the telecommunications provider to collect and process data describing accounts receivable,
to generate and deliver invoices, to support customer service call centers, and to interface with
other business support systems. These products are mission-critical to telecommunications
providers inasmuch as they can affect their cash flow, customer relationship management and the
ability to rapidly define, design, package and market competitive services more quickly and
efficiently than their competitors. All sales for billing software and services were completed
through the Company&#146;s direct sales force.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Many times each month, CTI&#146;s service provider clients deliver complete billing information for
their SmartBill&#174; customers to CTI. This data is then processed by CTI using its
technology. The processed data is then made available to the service provider&#146;s customers on CD-ROM
or via the Internet. These customers utilize the end user application to create an array of
standard reports or they can create customized reports through the application of filters that
further refine their search for business support data. SmartBill&#174; also enables
customers to apply a flat rate or percentage mark-up for rebilling of communication charges to
internal or external clients. Each month, CTI processes more than 2&nbsp;billion call data records for
more than 8,000 end users of CTI&#146;s product suite.

performance delivered by CTI create lasting relationships. CTI&#146;s relationship with its largest
customers has spanned more than a decade. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company had sales to a single customer aggregating $3,533,571 (16% of revenues) and $4,220,835 (20%
of revenues), respectively. Such customer represents 18% and 21% of software sales, service fee
and license fee revenues for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
contract with this customer contains an automatic annual renewal provision renewable in March of
each year; however, such agreement also contains a 120-day advance notice termination provision.
The decline in revenue from this customer relates to the cancellation by the customer of several
accounts that were under the service minimums. The contract with this customer was renewed in March
2009. The loss of this customer would have a substantial negative impact on the Company&#146;s
operations and financial condition. There are four EIM customers that totaled $8,197,624 (61% of
EIM revenues) and $8,796,325 (61% of EIM revenues) for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. A loss of any of these customers would have a negative impact on the EIM segment and
CTI as a whole. Generally, the Company enters into multi-year service provider contracts which

Finally, the approval process ensures appropriate levels of accountability within the organization
while establishing a clear audit trail for financial control purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Organizations that leverage mobility services typically find that their services are being used for
a variety of commercial and non-commercial purposes. For example, an employee&#146;s cellular phone may
be used to make personal calls. Service providers benefit from personal usage of commercial
services by recognizing an increase in average revenue per user (&#147;ARPU&#148;). The service provider&#146;s
customer, however, needs to be able to recover the personal expenditures on such services,
appropriately manage the tax consequences, and accomplish this without incurring an increase in
overhead and administration costs. The tax consequences of personal usage of commercial services
is most apparent in the United Kingdom, where enterprises are statutorily required to disclose
personal usage and receive tax benefits only for commercial usage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers distribute SplitBill to organizations that need to recover personal expenditures
related to commercial communications services. SplitBill increases the ARPU of the provider in
three ways. First, the product ensures that all communications usage, regardless of the personal
nature of such usage, passes over the provider&#146;s network, therefore increasing the service
provider&#146;s revenues and profitability. Second, the provider experiences reduced customer loss. By
enabling enterprise end-users to leverage services for commercial and non-commercial purposes, the
service is further entrenched into the organization. Finally, the product solves a key financial
challenge for enterprise customers, delivering sustainable value, leading to an increase in revenue
by the service provider.

Proteus&#174; Trader, Proteus&#174; Enterprise, and Proteus&#174; Service Bureau (collectively, &#147;Proteus&#174;&#148;).
Telemanagement products are used by companies, institutions and government agencies for fiscal or
legal purposes to track communications activity and to control costs associated with operating
communications networks. Proteus&#174; is a user friendly, Microsoft Windows&#174; based product. Proteus&#174;
performs functions of call recording, call accounting, cost allocation, client bill-back, analyses
of trunk traffic and calling and usage patterns, toll fraud detection, directory services and
integration with other private branch exchange (&#147;PBX&#148;) peripheral products. Proteus&#174; also
integrates Internet, e-mail and mobile data analysis and reporting with its traditional voice
capabilities. The Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and services have been developed, and
historically marketed, primarily in Europe. Telemanagement product sales are made through direct
and distributor sales channels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has also invested in enhancing its telemanagement solution for the new wave of IP
telephony products and has already been approved by several leading telecom manufacturers to bundle
Proteus&#174; with their IP solution at the source. The Company believes that this strategy positions it
for global expansion, as IP technology gains market share.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As well as creating new market opportunities, this IP telephony integration provides many
operational benefits, in that it requires no site visit for installation and self learns

companies, hospitals, universities, government agencies and investment banks. CTI anticipates that
it can further expand its products and services through internal development of its own
technological capabilities, by seeking to partner with companies offering complementary technology
or by pursuing possible acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CTI generates revenue through service bureau contracts, software licensing agreements and
maintenance agreements supporting licensed software. Maintenance agreements are either on a time
and material basis or full service agreements that are generally for a period of 1&nbsp;year. For
software licensing agreements on a direct distribution basis, payment terms are a 50% deposit upon
receipt of order and the 50% balance upon installation, which is normally completed within 10&nbsp;days.
Occasionally, larger software orders may require up to 3&nbsp;months to complete, custom software
development and installation. For software licensing via distributor channels, payment terms are
net 30&nbsp;days. Service bureau contracts provide monthly recurring revenue. Generally, contracts of
12 to 36&nbsp;months carry automatic 12-month renewals until canceled. CTI purchases data collection
devices specifically designed for use with telecommunications switches and other hardware such as
modems as are necessary to perform the telemanagement business. CTI rents or resells such
equipment to end-users.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As voice and data services continue to commoditize, the Company anticipates that service providers
will be seeking alternative business models to replace revenue lost directly as a result of pricing
pressures. The Company believes that one such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted
voice and video services. The Company&#146;s VoIP segment designs, develops and provides software and
services that enable managed and hosted customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and
data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform administration and back office functions
such as cost allocation or client bill back.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first being that organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second being that the
capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and ARPU advantage possible by delivering such managed and hosted service
offerings, providers not only look at acquiring new customers but converting legacy customers onto
the NGN platform. This conversion process, while potentially producing marked financial results
for a service provider, is not trivial. Many legacy features and functions are not available on
NGN platforms, primarily due to the immaturity of the service delivery model.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications are intended to eliminate customer resistance to conversion to NGN
platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the delivery of
compelling value added services. The Company primarily markets two applications, emPulse and
SmartRecord&#174; IP. These applications enable managed and hosted service customers of service
providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform
administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back. These
applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade products. Customers can
purchase these products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The
Company has taken the business benefits of these enterprise-grade applications and has delivered
provider-grade managed and hosted service applications intended to enable service providers to
create a new recurring revenue stream, while ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools
necessary and relevant to their particular line of business or vertical.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>SmartRecord&#174; </I>IP was released in February&nbsp;2007. SmartRecord&#174; IP provides integrated call recording
options to service providers for their hosted and managed service customers. Based upon patent

and archive communications for regulatory and quality management purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers can distribute these products to their managed and hosted service customers by
either directly reselling the product or by integrating it into an existing service bundle,
increasing the value and price of the overall bundle offering. The Company believes that the
overall VoIP market will grow.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CTI owns two patents which cover a method and process to prepare, display, and analyze usage and
cost information for services including, but not limited to, telecommunications, financial card
services, and utilities (e.g., electricity, oil, gas, water). The patents expire in 2011. The
information can be provided to a user in an advantageous format that allows the user to quickly and
easily retrieve, display, and analyze the information. The systems covered by these patents enable
customer data to be sorted and processed in a manner so that the customer&#146;s generation of reports
is much faster than using a non-patented method. This patented technology is incorporated in the
Company&#146;s SmartBill&#174; product. Other companies have developed programs to replicate this patented
process that the Company believes violate its patents.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has historically undertaken numerous enforcement activities, in which it has been
successful in certain instances in enforcing its patents. As a matter of course, the defense of an
outstanding lawsuit attacks the validity of the patents. The Company does not anticipate that such
attack will be successful but the results of litigation are difficult to predict. There can be no
assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in enforcing its patents in the future or
potentially be defeated in its enforcement activities, which could then jeopardize the successful
future enforcement activities. Since patent enforcement activities require significant outlay for
professional legal costs, the Company anticipates it will undertake future enforcement activities
under contingency arrangements with legal counsel. Except for legal out of pocket expenses, legal
professional fees are typically payable upon successful recoveries. See Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal

the service provider focused on supporting the provider&#146;s enterprise customers who had complex
service mixes and difficult to manage billing hierarchies. As such, the Company competed in a very
narrowly defined niche. The Company found itself competing against electronic bill presentment and

patents on its SmartBill&#174; and SmartBill&#174; Connect processes. These patents enable customer data to
be sorted in a manner so that the customer&#146;s generation of reports is much faster than using a
non-patented method.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s major competitors include: CheckFree Services Corp., edocs, Inc., Amdocs Limited,
Veramark Technologies, Inc., Info Directions, Inc. In addition to these direct competitors, the
Company faces intense competition from internal IT within the service providers&#146; business
operations.

many competitors which may be better capitalized than the Company. The Company&#146;s primary
competitors of SmartRecord&#174; IP include Telrex, and Orecx. emPulse competes against hosted call
center applications such as CosmoCom and Contactual, Inc. When competing against these providers,
CTI differentiates itself through both technological advantages and pricing stategies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Telemanagement</I>. The Company&#146;s Telemanangement segment operates in a highly fragmented market.
Competitors, such as Avotus&#174; Corporation, BTS, Softech, Inc., Oak, Tiger, and Veramark
Technologies, Inc., which may be larger and better capitalized, compete against the Company in the
telemanagement sector. The Company differentiates itself from its competitors based on reporting
capabilities and ease of user interface. Proteus&#174; integrates with a wide variety of telephone
systems and third party applications such as dealer boards and voice recording equipment.
ProteusTM also connects directly over the local area network, which eliminates the need for cables
that are associated with similar products.

carefully consider all of the information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this
Form 10-K and, in particular, the risks described below before investing in our Class&nbsp;A common
stock or other securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial
condition or results of operations could be materially harmed and you may lose part or all of your
investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional
risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our business may be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as general
geopolitical economic and business conditions, conditions in the financial services markets, and
changes in the overall demand for networking products. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn
could adversely affect our customers&#146; financial condition and the levels of business activity of
our customers. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could cause businesses to
postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income
or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for networking products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The current economic crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the current
uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a
low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in credit, equity,
currency and fixed income markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from these economic
developments and negative economic trends on our business, including the inability of customers to
obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; customer insolvencies; decreased customer
confidence to make purchasing decisions; decreased customer demand; and decreased customer ability
to pay their trade obligations. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow additional funds under
our existing loan agreements and may not be able to expand our existing facilities if our lender
becomes in-solvent or its liquidity is limited or impaired. In addition, we may not be able to
renew our existing loan agreements at the conclusion of their current terms or renew it on terms
that are favorable to us.

geographic markets remain uncertain or weaken further, such conditions could have a material
adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if we are
unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to
effectively plan for and respond to those changes, which could materially adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

price of &#163;5.6&nbsp;million, which was equal to approximately $11.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;22, 2006. The
assets of CTI Billing Solutions Limited consist primarily of goodwill, intangible assets, cash and
accounts receivable. We recorded intangible assets of approximately $6.0&nbsp;million and goodwill of
approximately $4.9&nbsp;million related to the CTI Billing Solutions Limited acquisition. We will
continuously assess the value of the intangibles; however, there can be no assurances that there

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>Control of our stock is concentrated among our directors and executive officers and their
respective affiliates who can exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder
approval</I></U><I>.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of March&nbsp;11, 2009, our directors and executive officers and their respective affiliates
beneficially owned 75.0% of the outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. These stockholders can exercise
significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
directors and the approval of major corporate transactions. Such concentration of ownership may
also delay or prevent a change in control of us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>We are subject to the penny stock rules which may adversely affect trading in our Class&nbsp;A
common stock.</I></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;11, 2009, the closing price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock was $0.05. Our Class&nbsp;A common
stock is a &#147;penny stock&#148; security under the rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. In accordance
with these rules, broker-dealers participating in certain transactions involving penny stocks must
first deliver a disclosure document that describes, among other matters, the risks associated with
trading in penny stocks. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must make a suitability determination
approving the customer for penny stock transactions based on the customer&#146;s financial situation,
investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these determinations in
writing to the customer and obtain specific written consent from the customer. The effect of these
restrictions will probably decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market in our Class
A common stock, decrease liquidity of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and increase transaction costs for
sales and purchases of our Class&nbsp;A common stock as compared to other securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U><I>There is not presently an active market for shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, and, therefore,
you may be unable to sell any shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock in the event that you need a source of
liquidity.</I></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Although our Class&nbsp;A common stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, the trading in
our Class&nbsp;A common stock has substantially less liquidity than the trading in the securities of
many other companies listed on that market. A public trading market in the securities having the
desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market
of willing buyers and sellers of our securities at any time. This presence depends on the
individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no
control. In the event an active market for the securities does not develop, you may be unable to
resell your shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at or above the price you pay for them or at any price.

of $257,643 per year. The Indianapolis lease expires in February&nbsp;2014. The Company leases 3,485
square feet of office space near London in the United Kingdom at an annual rate equivalent
approximately to $65,000 per annum. The London lease expires in December&nbsp;2013; however, it can be
cancelled without penalty with a six month advance notice. The Company leased 9,360 square feet of
office space in Blackburn in the United Kingdom at an annual rate equivalent to approximately
$145,000. The Blackburn lease expired December&nbsp;2008; however, the Company has been allowed to
remain in the existing space at existing terms and is actively renegotiating a new lease with the
landlord. The Company believes it will be successful in negotiating a lease at terms more favorable
than those existing. The Company believes that, although its facilities are adequate to meet its
current level of sales, additional space may be required to support future growth.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company filed a lawsuit for patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. &#167;271 et seq. against BellSouth
Corporation (&#147;BellSouth&#148;), Citizens Communications, Inc., Convergys Corporation, Mid America
Computer Corporation, Qwest, Telephone Data Systems, Inc. and Traq-Wireless, Inc. in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on January&nbsp;12, 2004. The lawsuit seeks
treble damages, attorneys&#146; fees and an injunction for infringement of U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company settled with defendant Telephone Data Systems, Inc. and dismissed its complaint against
it on July&nbsp;16, 2004. The Company also settled with defendant Traq-Wireless, Inc. and dismissed the
complaint against it on July&nbsp;30, 2004. The Company dismissed its complaint against Mid America
Computer Corporation on April&nbsp;12, 2004 and against Citizens Communications, Inc. on July&nbsp;22, 2004.
The Company has amended its complaint to substitute Qwest Corporation and Qwest Communications
International, Inc. as defendants instead of Qwest.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;21, 2004, an action was brought against the Company in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Georgia by BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., BellSouth Business Systems,
Inc. and BellSouth Billing, Inc. seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity
of the Company&#146;s Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. The parties to both lawsuits involving BellSouth negotiated
a settlement agreement in September&nbsp;2004, and the revenue for the settlement was recorded in the
quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004. The complaint against Bellsouth was dismissed on October&nbsp;4,
2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Qwest Corporation filed a motion in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana seeking to dismiss the complaint against it on jurisdictional grounds or, alternatively, to
transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The
parties then engaged in jurisdictional discovery. On February&nbsp;14, 2005, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Indiana denied the motion as moot in light of the consolidation
of this action with the action disclosed under &#147;Qwest Corporation.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2005, an anonymous request for reexamination of the Company&#146;s U. S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270 was
filed with the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO). The Company suspects that such request was filed as a
tactical matter from one or more of the aforementioned defendants. The Company believes that the
request for reexamination is without merit. In May of 2006, the USPTO issued a Notice of Intent to
Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate. Subsequent to that time, the Company has submitted
numerous additional documents for consideration by the USPTO, the last such filing being in July
2007. The Company is unable to determine the outcome or ramifications of the reexamination at this
time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;13, 2005, Qwest Corporation, Qwest International and Qwest Communications Corporation filed
a motion to stay the litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana, which was denied by the Court. On July&nbsp;20, 2005, the foregoing Qwest entities filed a
renewed motion for stay, which was denied by the Court.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On September&nbsp;26, 2008, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Convergys Corporation,
whereby the Company received $2.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Qwest Corporation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;11, 2004, an action was brought against the Company in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Washington by Qwest Corporation seeking a declaratory judgment of
non-infringement and invalidity of the Company&#146;s Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. An amended complaint was
filed on July&nbsp;13, 2004 adding Qwest Communications Corporation to that action. The Company filed a
motion with the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking to
dismiss that action or, in the alternative, to transfer it to the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Indiana.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;12, 2004, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington
granted the Company&#146;s motion to the extent of transferring the action to the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The Company asserted counterclaims alleging patent
infringement and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana then
consolidated the transferred action with the pending patent infringement lawsuit disclosed above
under &#147;BellSouth Corporation et al.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;9, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana issued
its claim construction for U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. On January&nbsp;18, 2008, Qwest entities filed a
motion for stay and a summary judgment motion of invalidity based on the construction of one of the
claim terms. The motions were fully briefed on an expedited basis and on February&nbsp;26, 2008, the
court denied the motions. Expert discovery is proceeding and the court has set a trial date in
September&nbsp;2009.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Overview</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagment (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice Over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute such software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications expenses while driving
internal efficiencies into their invoice receipt, validation, approval and payment workflow
processes. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor
communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or
client bill back. These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade
products. Customers typically purchase the VoIP products when upgrading or acquiring a new
enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection,
enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates its revenues and cash from several sources: software sales, license fees,
processing fees, implementation fees, training and consulting services, and enforcement revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s software products and services are subject to changing technology and evolving
customer needs which require the Company to continually invest in research and development in order
to respond to such demands. The limited financial resources available to the Company require the
Company to concentrate on those business segments and product lines which the Company believes will
provide the greatest returns on investment. The EIM segment, as compared to the other business
segments, provides the predominant share of income from operations and cash flow from operations.
The majority of Telemanagement segment revenues are derived from the Company&#146;s United Kingdom
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that as voice and data services continue to commoditize, service providers are
seeking alternative business models to replace revenue lost directly as a result of pricing
pressures. One such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted voice and video services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first being that organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second being that the
capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and average revenue per user advantage possible by delivering such
managed and hosted service offerings, providers not only look at acquiring new customers but
converting legacy customers onto the NGN platform. The Company believes that this conversion
process is significant. Many legacy features and functions are not available on NGN platforms,
primarily due to the immaturity of the service delivery model.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s new hosted voice and video over IP applications will help eliminate customer
resistance to conversion to next generation platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for
service providers through the delivery of compelling value added services. In 2007, the Company
marketed two applications, emPulse, web-based communications traffic analysis solution, and
SmartRecord&#174; IP, which enable service providers to selectively intercept communications on behalf
of their hosted and managed service customers. These applications will also enable managed and
hosted service customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and
monitor communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost
allocation or client bill back. These applications were released as enterprise-grade products in
the first quarter of 2007. The Company anticipates that customers will purchase these products
when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The Company has taken the
business benefits of these enterprise-grade applications and has delivered provider-grade managed
and hosted service applications, enabling service providers to create a new recurring revenue
stream, while ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools necessary and relevant to their
particular line of business or vertical. The Company&#146;s future success in the VoIP segment is
directly related to the successful market penetration of emPulse and SmartRecord&#174; IP.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the stockholders&#146; equity increased $1,361,726 from
$8,406,664 as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 to $9,768,390 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 primarily as a result of
the fiscal year 2008 net income of $815,581 and the change in comprehensive income of $342,559
related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents
were $341,936 compared to $555,839 at December&nbsp;31, 2007. The Company realized a decline in net
current assets (current assets less current liabilities) of approximately $705,662 which was
primarily attributable to the expenditure of cash and cash equivalents to reduce long-term debt by
$2,100,000. The reduction of long-term debt was funded by cash provided by operating activities of
$2,927,991.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates approximately 65% of its revenues from operations in the United Kingdom where
the functional currency, the United Kingdom pound, has weakened by approximately 26.3% in relation
to the US dollar as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 compared to December&nbsp;31, 2007. The average conversion
rate for the United Kingdom pound into a United States dollar for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008

compared to $21,344,922 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The increase in revenue was
primarily the result of the increase in revenue in the Company&#146;s Patent Enforcement Segement.
Telemanagement revenue increased $135,640 to $6,000,676 in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 from
$5,865,036 in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Revenue from the VoIP segment was $211,752 in the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 an increase of $66,431 compared to $145,321 recognized in the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Patent license fee revenue increased $1,950,481 to $2,850,000 in the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 from $899,519 in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The aforementioned
revenue increases were partially offset by decreases in the EIM segment revenue of $953,920 which
was primarily attributable to reduced processing revenue from the Company&#146;s largest EIM customer.
A major customer represented 16% of total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 20% of
total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, and such customer represented 18% of software
sales, service fee and license fee revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 21% for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.

to $1,962,668 as compared to $1,779,816 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The increase was
primarily related to a $690,135 increase of contingent legal fees incurred in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 when compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 due to an increase in the
amount of settlement revenue recognized in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 the increase in

from $2,140,319 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the
amortization expense associated with the original release of SmartBill&#174; Connect being fully
recognized in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. Approximately $421,371 and $802,958 of
amortization expense was related to capitalized software costs for the years ended December&nbsp;31,

Enhancements; as a result, the Company recorded a corresponding impairment charge of $199,374 in
the fourth quarter of 2007. There were no cash expenditures made in 2007 which were associated with
the Product Enhancements. The Company anticipates there will be no future cash expenditures related

products and services, patent enforcement activities, selling, general and administrative expenses,
research and development, and working capital needs), and capital expenditures, including software
development. Cash flows from operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments have been adequate to meet our business objectives. Cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments decreased by $213,903 to $341,936 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 from $555,839 as
of December&nbsp;31, 2007<I>. </I>Cash provided by operations was $2,927,991, cash used in investing activity
was $1,012,086, and cash used in financing activities was $2,100,000 for the year ended December
31, 2008. Cash flow provided by operations of $2,927,991 was primarily attributable to the
Company&#146;s recognizing a net income of $815,581 in connection with a non-cash add-back of
depreciation and amortization of $1,573,877. Cash flows used in investing activities of $1,012,086
related primarily to capitalized costs incurred in the development and enhancements of the
Company&#146;s products. Cash flows used in financing activities of $2,100,000 was attributable to the
$2,100,000 reduction of debt. Cash generated from the EIM, Telemanagement, and Patent Enforcement
segments of $3,552,391, $562,014, and $864,342, respectively, was off-set by cash used in the VoIP
segment of $2,693,366 and Corporate expenses of $1,011,018. For December&nbsp;31, 2008, income from
operations on a geographical basis amounted to $376,726 for the United States and $897,637 for the
United Kingdom. The Company anticipates that its cash needs will be met during the next twelve

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s net income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 of $815,581 was primarily due to a
patent enforcement settlement of $2,850,000 being realized for the year. Net income realized from
patent enforcement activities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $953,008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company experienced a net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The primary reason for
the net loss was a loss of $811,742 in the Company&#146;s Patent Enforcement segment related to an
increase in hourly legal fees along with increased amortization expense of $695,318 related to
intangibles acquired in the CTI Billing Solutions Limited acquisition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a single EIM customer. This single
customer generated approximately $3,533,571 (16% of total revenue) of revenues in fiscal 2008 and
$4,220,835 (20% of total revenue) in fiscal 2007. Although that customer&#146;s contract includes an
automatic annual renewal provision effective each March, it does contain a 120-day prior
notification termination clause. The contract was renewed in March&nbsp;2009. The loss of that
customer would have a substantial negative impact on the Company&#146;s operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has one credit facility consisting of an acquisition loan and a revolving loan. The
document governing this credit facility is referred to as the Loan Agreement. During 2006, the
Company had available a revolving loan with National City Bank, a national banking association
(&#147;NCB&#148;) for the lesser of (a) $8,000,000, or (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic trade accounts
receivable, 90% of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable and 100% of cash placed in
a restricted account. All borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the
Company. On November&nbsp;13, 2007, the Company and bank amended the revolving loan to reduce the
available sum to $3,000,000 and to remove the cash placed in a restricted account. Effective
November&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company and NCB entered into a Second Modification of Loan Documents (the
&#147;Second Modification&#148;). The Second Modification reduced the amount of the $2,600,000 acquisition
loan (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;) entered into with NCB to $500,000 upon the Company&#146;s prepayment of
$2.1&nbsp;million of the Acquisition Loan. The Second Modification modified the terms of the Revolving
Loan to state that the sum of (a)&nbsp;advances made on the Revolving Loan, and (b)&nbsp;any Company debt
that is not secured by cash or a letter of credit, may not exceed four times the trailing twelve
(12)&nbsp;month consolidated EBITDA. The revolving loan expires on December&nbsp;30, 2010, unless extended.
Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest (2.97% at December&nbsp;31, 2008) at LIBOR plus 2.50%
payable monthly. The amendment also changed certain financial covenants and borrowing availability
under the revolving loan. The outstanding balance on the revolving loan was $0 at December&nbsp;31,
2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007. The carrying amount of receivables, that serve as collateral for
borrowings, totaled $1,561,652 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and $1,951,110 at December&nbsp;31, 2007. Available
borrowing under the revolving loan at December&nbsp;31, 2008 amounted to $1,561,652.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Acquisition Loan is secured by a letter of credit from SEB Bank to NCB. The letter of credit
was secured by a guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British
Virgin Islands company (&#147;Fairford&#148;). As of March&nbsp;12, 2009, Fairford beneficially owned 64.0% of
the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock and director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole
beneficiary of a revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of
the Company, is the director of Fairford. Under the Second Modification, NCB removed the provision
in the Loan Agreement requiring that the Company obtain a letter of credit as security for the
Acquisition Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Modification, NCB executed a notice of
termination and release of the Letter of Credit dated November&nbsp;18, 2008. In connection with the
Second Modification, the Company issued to NCB an Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan Promissory
Note dated November&nbsp;18, 2008 (the &#147;Amended Acquisition Loan Note&#148;), which replaced the $2.6&nbsp;million
note and reflected the reduced Acquisition Loan principal amount of $500,000. The Amended and
Restated Acquisition Loan expires on December&nbsp;21, 2009, unless extended. Borrowings under the
acquisition loan bear interest (2.47% at December&nbsp;31, 2008) at LIBOR plus 2.00% payable monthly.
All borrowings under the Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan are collateralized by substantially
all assets of the Company. The outstanding balances on the Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan
and the Acquisition Loan were $500,000 and $2,600,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007,
respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Borrowings under the Loan Agreement are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on
indebtedness, encumbrances, investments, business combinations, and other related items. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. The more significant
covenants under the Loan Agreement, include that, without NCB&#146;s prior written consent, the Company

Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition and accounts receivable reserves, depreciation and amortization, investments, income
taxes, capitalized software, accrued compensation, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

estimating the Company&#146;s actual current tax obligations together with assessing differences
resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS
No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes&#148;. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these differences
are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are assessed each reporting period as to whether it is more
likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income, including assumptions

uncertain, the Company will establish a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be
recovered. Changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax
provision in the statement of operations.

tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the tax position
would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The
amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than not&#148; test, no tax
benefit is recorded. The Company believes that its tax positions would more likely than not be
sustained in a tax examination and therefore has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax
positions.

annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. There were no impairments
in 2008 and 2007. Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful
lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried
at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives
of the respective assets, generally 3-15&nbsp;years. Intangible assets consist of patents, purchased
technology, trademarks and trade names, and customer lists.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s goodwill and significant component of its intangible assets relate to CTI Billing
Solutions Limited. That entity is considered a separate reporting unit under guidance of FAS 142
and the Company performed its annual impairment analysis on goodwill as of the October&nbsp;1, 2008, to
coincide with the calendar date set in past years for this analysis. The Company&#146;s analysis
considered the projected cash flows of the reporting unit and gave consideration to appropriate
factors in determining a discount rate to be applied to these cash flows. The Company engaged the
same outside firm as was used in past years to assist in this analysis. The Company is satisfied as
to the qualifications and independence of this firm with respect to their ability to assist in this
analysis. The results of this analysis indicated that there was no FAS 142, Step One impairment as
of the date of our annual impairment determination.

the Company&#146;s stock was approximately $1.5&nbsp;million which is well below the Company&#146;s reported book
value at December&nbsp;31, 2008 of approximately $9.5&nbsp;million.

assumptions utilized in the impairment determination and again found that there existed no
impairment. The Company&#146;s operations of the business unit are primarily based on recurring revenues
and have not experienced an adverse change in anticipated performance considered in the impairment
analysis. The business units operating performance subsequent to the goodwill impairment analysis
has exceeded anticipated performance through the most recent period that information is available.

impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such

consistent with the requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SAB
104&#148;). In general, the Company records revenue when it is realized, or realizable, and earned.
Revenues from software licenses are recognized upon shipment, delivery or customer acceptance,
based on the substance of the arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided there are
no significant remaining vendor obligations to be fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably
assured. Software sales revenue is generated from licensing software to new customers and from
licensing additional users and new applications to existing customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in Statement of Position (&#147;SOP&#148;) 97-2
&#147;Software Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SOP 97-2&#148;). Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training,
consulting, and customization are recognized as provided to customers. If the services are
essential to the functionality of the software, revenue from the software component is deferred
until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth in paragraph 65 of
SOP 97-2. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the entire arrangement is accounted
for in conformity with Accounting Research Bulletin (&#147;ARB&#148;) No.&nbsp;45 &#147;Long-Term Construction-Type
Contracts&#148;, using the relevant guidance in SOP 81-1 &#147;Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts&#148;. The Company carefully evaluates the
circumstances surrounding the implementations to determine whether the percentage-of-completion
method or the completed-contract method should be used. Most implementations relate to the
Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in less than 30&nbsp;days once the work begins. The
Company uses the completed-contract method on contracts that will be completed within 30&nbsp;days since
it produces a result similar to the percentage-of-completion method. On contracts that will take
over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company uses the percentage-of-completion method of contract
accounting.

experience and any specific customer collection issues that the Company has identified. If the
financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Where an allowance for doubtful
accounts has been established with respect to customer receivables, as payments are made on such
receivables or if the customer goes out of business with no chance of collection, the allowances
will decrease with a corresponding adjustment to accounts receivable as deemed appropriate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Statement No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurements </I>(&#147;FAS 157&#148;). This
Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement establishes a fair value hierarchy about
the assumptions used to measure fair value and clarifies assumptions about risk and the effect of a
restriction on the sale or use of an asset. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP)&nbsp;157-2, <I>Effective
Date of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;157 </I>(&#147;FSP 157-2&#148;). This FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of FAS 157
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after
November&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of FAS 157 as it
relates to financial assets and financial liabilities had no effect on the Company&#146;s financial
statements. The Company anticipates there will be no material impact of the adoption of FSP 157-2
on the Company&#146;s financial statements. In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;157-3, <I>Determining
the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for that Asset is Not Active </I>(&#147;FSP 157-3&#148;),
which clarifies the application of FAS 157 in an inactive market. FSP 157-3 explains that when
relevant and observable market information is not available to determine the measurement of an
asset&#146;s fair value, management must use their judgment about the assumptions a market participant
would use in pricing the asset in a current sale transaction. Appropriate risk adjustments that a
market participant would use must also be taken into account when determining the fair value.
Application of this guidance should be accounted for as a change in estimate and FSP 157-3 was
effective upon issuance. Upon adoption of FSP 157-3, the Company anticipates there will be no
material impact on the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated financial statements.

these financial statements based on our audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>NOTE 1 &#151; DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BUSINESS: </I>CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. and wholly-owned subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;CTI&#148;) design,
develop, market and support billing and data management software and services. The Company
operates in four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management, Telemanagement, Hosted Voice
Over Internet Protocol and Patent Enforcement Activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s future operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could
affect future operating results and cause actual results to vary from historical results include,
but are not limited to: adverse economic conditions, risks associated with doing business outside
the United States, significant foreign currency fluctuations, restrictive loan covenants,
impairments may be recorded on intangibles, loss of its significant customers, inability to enhance
existing products and services to meet the evolving needs of customers, the Company&#146;s inability to
compete successfully, failure to enforce intellectual property rights, damage done to relationships
with potential customers by the Company&#146;s attempt to enforce intellectual property rights, the
Company&#146;s inability to successfully enter new markets, the Company&#146;s inability to maintain an
effective system of internal controls, control of the Company&#146;s stock is concentrated among
directors and officers, the Company is subject to penny stock rules which may adversely affect
trading of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, and there is not presently an active market for the
Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</I>: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION</I>: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company&#146;s wholly owned United Kingdom-based subsidiaries. The financial statements of the
Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements and have
been translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;52, &#147;Foreign Currency Translation.&#148; Assets and liabilities are translated at current
rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date and stockholder&#146;s equity is translated at
historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for
the applicable period. Any resulting translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated
other comprehensive income. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is a
transaction gain of approximately $4,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and a transaction
loss of approximately $105,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS</I>: Cash and cash equivalents include the cash on hand, demand deposits and
highly liquid investments. The Company considers all highly liquid investments, with maturity of
three months or less, to be cash equivalents.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>ADVERTISING COSTS: </I>The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, advertising expense was $116,234 and $105,752, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>USE OF ESTIMATES</I>: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates utilized by the Company include the
determination of the collectibility of receivables, valuation of stock options, recoverability
and/or impairment of intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, accrued compensation and
other liabilities, commitments and contingencies, and capitalization and impairment of computer
software development costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During fiscal 2004, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement relating to patent
enforcement activities for $1,200,000 of which the Company received $100,000 of cash and accepted a
note which matures on June&nbsp;30, 2010, for the remaining $1,100,000. The Company recorded the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">payments at a discount with imputed interest of 10%. The Company placed a reserve on the note when
it was received in 2004 due to the uncertain financial position of the company issuing the note.
In 2007, the issuer of the note was acquired by a financially stable company and the Company
reversed the reserve on the note receivable. The balance of this note at the time of reversal was
$474,519 which was recorded as revenue in the Patent Enforcement Activities segment. The reversal
of this reserve increased earnings per share by $0.01 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</I>: The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist primarily of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, note and settlement receivables, accounts payable, and
accrued expenses. The book values of these financial instruments are considered to be
representative of their respective fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments. At
December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying value of certain financial instruments approximates fair
value due to either the short-term nature of the instruments or interest rates, which are
comparable with current rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: </I>Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Furniture,
fixtures and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of three to five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of the lease or the useful lives of the
improvements, whichever is shorter. All maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as
incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</I>: Under the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed&#148; (&#147;SFAS 86&#148;), expenditures for producing product
masters incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and are
amortized on a product-by-product basis ranging from three to four years. The amortization is
computed using the greater of (a)&nbsp;the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the
product or (b)&nbsp;the ratio that the current gross revenue for the products bear to the total current
and anticipated future gross revenue of the products. SFAS 86 requires the periodic evaluation of
the net realizable value of capitalized computer software costs. The excess of any unamortized
computer software costs over its related net realizable value at a balance sheet date shall be
written down. See Note 4 &#151; Property, Equipment and Software Development Costs. The Company
capitalized $838,493 and $493,718 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in
costs related to its software development. The amortization expense for developed software which
relates to cost of sales was $421,371 and $802,958 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: </I>Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between
annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. There were no impairments
in 2008 and 2007. Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful
lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried
at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives
of the respective assets, generally 3-15&nbsp;years. Intangible assets consist of patents, purchased
technology, trademarks and trade names, and customer lists.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>LONG-LIVED ASSETS</I>: The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived
assets, including intangible assets with definite lives using the methodology prescribed in SFAS
No.&nbsp;144 &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148;. Long-lived assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the
carrying amount of the assets to the
undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates there is impairment, the
amount of the impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS</I>: Costs relating to obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over
the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt.
Interest expense relating to the amortization of the deferred financing costs amounted to $203,766
and $244,638 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>REVENUE RECOGNITION: </I>The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements
of Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, &#147;Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SAB 104&#148;). In general, the Company

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s Telemanagement sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software.
Service revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in Statement of Position (&#147;SOP&#148;) 97-2
&#147;Software Revenue Recognition&#148; (&#147;SOP 97-2&#148;). Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training,
consulting, and customization are recognized as provided to customers. If the services are
essential to the functionality of the software, revenue from the software component is deferred
until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth in paragraph 65 of
SOP 97-2. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the entire arrangement is accounted
for in conformity with Accounting Research Bulletin Opinion No.&nbsp;45 &#147;Long-term Construction Type
Contracts&#148;, using the relevant guidance in SOP 81-1 &#147;Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts&#148;. The Company carefully evaluates the
circumstances surrounding the implementations to determine whether the percentage-of-completion
method or the completed-contract method should be used. Most implementations relate to the
Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in less than 30&nbsp;days once the work begins. The
Company uses the completed-contract method on contracts that will be completed within 30&nbsp;days since
it produces a result similar to the percentage-of-completion method. On contracts that will take
over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company uses the percentage-of-completion method of contract
accounting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable. In 2008, the Company established a reserve of $206,110 on a note receivable
related to patent license and enforcement revenues due to the insolvency of the debtor.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO PATENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES: </I>Professional fees and legal costs incurred
while pursuing patent license fee and enforcement revenues are expensed as incurred. Legal fees
that are contingent on the successful outcome of an enforcement claim are recorded when the patent
license fee and enforcement revenues are realized.

equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those
awards at the date of grant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>INCOME TAXES</I>: The Company accounts for income taxes following the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;109
&#147;Accounting for Income Taxes&#148;, which requires recording income taxes under the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes
are recognized for the tax consequences of &#147;temporary differences&#148; by applying enacted statutory
tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is recorded based on a determination of the ultimate realizability of net
deferred tax assets. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
48 &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (&#147;FIN 48&#148;). A tax position is recognized as a
benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the tax position would be sustained in a tax
examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest
amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax
positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than not&#148; test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company
believes that its tax positions would more likely than not be sustained in a tax examination
therefore has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BASIC AND DILUTED INCOME / (LOSS)&nbsp;PER COMMON SHARE</I>: Net income (loss)&nbsp;per common share is computed
in accordance with the provision of SFAS No.&nbsp;128, &#147;Earnings Per Share&#148;. Basic earnings (loss)&nbsp;per
share is computed by dividing reported earnings (loss)&nbsp;available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss)&nbsp;per
share is computed by dividing reported earnings (loss)&nbsp;available to common stockholders by adjusted
weighted average shares outstanding for the year assuming the exercise of all potentially dilutive
stock options and warrants.

Statement No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurements </I>(&#147;FAS 157&#148;). This Statement defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. This Statement establishes a fair value hierarchy about the assumptions used to
measure fair value and clarifies assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale
or use of an asset. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007.
In February&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP)&nbsp;157-2, <I>Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
157 </I>(&#147;FSP 157-2&#148;). This FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of FAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of FAS 157 as it relates to financial assets and
financial liabilities had no effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements. The Company anticipates
there will be no material impact of the adoption of FSP 157-2 on the Company&#146;s financial
statements. In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;157-3, <I>Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When the Market for that Asset
is Not Active </I>(&#147;FSP 157-3&#148;), which clarifies the application of FAS 157 in an inactive market. FSP
157-3 explains that when relevant and observable market information is not available to determine
the measurement of an asset&#146;s fair value, management must use their judgment about the assumptions
a market participant would use in pricing the asset in a current sale transaction. Appropriate
risk adjustments that a market participant would use must also be taken into account when
determining the fair value. Application of this guidance should be accounted for as a change in
estimate and FSP 157-3 was effective upon issuance. Upon adoption of FSP 157-3, the Company
anticipates there will be no material impact on the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated financial
statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Rent and lease expense was $561,038 and $646,443 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The Company leased 15,931 square feet of office space in Indianapolis for an average
of $257,643 per year. The Indianapolis lease expires in February&nbsp;2014. The Company leases 3,485
square feet of office space near London in the United Kingdom at an annual cost equivalent to
approximately $65,000 per annum. The London lease expires in December&nbsp;2013 but the Company may
terminate the lease effective January, 2007 or thereafter, upon a minimum of six months advance
notice of the date of termination and payment of the equivalent of one quarterly rent payment. The
Company leases 9,360 square feet of office space in Blackburn in the United Kingdom at an annual
rate equivalent to approximately $145,000. The Blackburn lease expired in December&nbsp;2008; however,
the Company has been allowed to remain in the existing space at existing terms and is actively
renegotiating a new lease with the landlord. The Company believes it will be successful in
negotiating a lease at terms more favorable than those existing. The Company believes that,
although its facilities are adequate to meet its current level of sales, additional space may be
required to support future growth.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has the following debt obligations (&#147;Loan Agreements&#148;).

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2006, the Company had available a revolving loan with National City Bank, a national banking
association (&#147;NCB&#148;) for the lesser of (a) $8,000,000, or (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic
trade accounts receivable, 90% of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable and 100% of
cash placed in a restricted account (the &#147;Revolving Loan&#148;). All borrowings are collateralized by
substantially all assets of the Company. On November&nbsp;13, 2007, the Company and bank amended the
revolving loan to reduce the available sum to $3,000,000 and to remove the cash placed in a
restricted account. Effective November&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company and NCB entered into a Second
Modification of Loan Documents (the &#147;Second Modification&#148;). The Second Modification reduced the
amount of the $2,600,000 acquisition loan (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;) entered into with National City
Bank, a national banking associations (&#147;NCB&#148;) to $500,000 upon the Company&#146;s prepayment of $2.1
million of the Acquisition Loan. The Second Modification also modified the terms of the Revolving
Loan to state that the sum of (a)&nbsp;advances made on the Revolving Loan, and (b)&nbsp;any Company debt
that is not secured by cash or a letter of credit, may not exceed four times the trailing twelve
(12)&nbsp;month consolidated EBITDA. The revolving loan expires on December&nbsp;30, 2010, unless extended.
Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest (2.97% at December&nbsp;31, 2008) at LIBOR plus 2.50%
payable monthly. The amendment also changed certain financial covenants and borrowing availability
under the revolving loan. The outstanding balance on the revolving loan was $0 at December&nbsp;31,
2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007. The carrying amount of receivables, that serves as collateral for
borrowings, totaled $1,561,652 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and $1,951,110 at December&nbsp;31, 2007. Available
borrowing under the revolving loan at December&nbsp;31, 2008 amounted to $1,561,652.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Acquisition Loan is secured by a letter of credit from SEB Bank to NCB. The letter of credit
was secured by a guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British
Virgin Islands company (&#147;Fairford&#148;). As of March&nbsp;12, 2009, Fairford beneficially owned 64.0% of
the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock and director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole
beneficiary of a revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of
the Company, is the director of Fairford. Under the Second Modification, NCB removed the provision
in the Loan Agreement requiring that the Company obtain a letter of credit as security for the
Acquisition Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Modification, NCB executed a notice of
termination and release of the Letter of Credit dated November&nbsp;18, 2008. In connection with the
Second Modification, the Company issued to NCB an Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan Promissory
Note dated November&nbsp;18, 2008 (the &#147;Amended Acquisition Loan Note&#148;), which replaced the $2,600,000
note and reflected the reduced Acquisition Loan principal amount of $500,000. The Amended and
Restated Acquisition Loan expires on December&nbsp;21, 2009, unless extended. Borrowings under the
acquisition loan bear interest (2.47% at December&nbsp;31, 2008) at LIBOR plus 2.00% payable monthly.
All borrowings under the Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan are collateralized by substantially
all assets of the Company. The outstanding balances on the Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan
and the Acquisition Loan were $500,000 and $2,600,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Borrowings under the Loan Agreements are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on
indebtedness, encumbrances, investments, business combinations, and other related items. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. The more significant
covenants under the Loan Agreements, include that, without NCB&#146;s prior written consent, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to: (i)&nbsp;incur or have outstanding any
indebtedness in excess of $20,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate; (ii)&nbsp;dispose of all,
or any part, of business or assets; (iii)&nbsp;make any acquisitions, or (iv)&nbsp;issue any additional
shares of stock or other securities and the Company shall not issue more than 10% of the Company&#146;s
capital stock pursuant to its stock option plan on a fully-diluted basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreements require the Company to pay a fee with respect to the unused portion of the
revolving loan of 0.25% per annum for each calendar quarter on the average daily amount by which
$3.0&nbsp;million exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the revolving loan during such calendar
quarter.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, they would favorably affect the effective income
tax rate in future periods. Consistent with the provisions of FIN 48, the Company has classified
certain income tax liabilities as current or noncurrent based on management&#146;s estimate of when
these liabilities will be settled.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., state of Indiana and the
foreign jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. The Company remains subject to examination by taxing
authorities in the jurisdictions the Company has filed returns for years after 2004. The Company
does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase in the next
twelve months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax
expense. The Company did not have any amounts accrued for interest and penalties at December&nbsp;31,
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s tax filings are subject periodically to regulatory review and audit. In November
2006, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company of the disallowance of the deductibility of
the write-off of a $10,500,000 promissory note taken during the 2003 tax year. On August&nbsp;8, 2007,
the Company agreed to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service. The settlement resulted in a
reduction of the Company&#146;s net operating loss carryforward by $4,945,467 on which the Company had
previously recorded a full valuation allowance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company had available unused net operating losses of $2,511,141 and tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $223,184 that may be applied against future taxable income
and that expire from 2009 to 2025. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning in making these assessments. At December&nbsp;31,
2008, the Company had a valuation allowance of $2,734,325 established against unused U.S. net
operating loss carryforwards of $2,511,141 and tax credits of $223,184 as utilization of these tax
attributes is not assured in the United States. In addition, at December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company
considered its cumulative earnings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) provided for
the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase, and restricted stock grants
of, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Individuals eligible for participation in the
Plan included designated officers and other employees (including employees who also serve as
directors), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants who perform services
for the Company. The terms of each grant under the Plan were determined by the Board of Directors,
or a committee of the board administering the Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a
change of control of the Company as in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Stock options
granted under the Plan typically become exercisable over a one to five year period. Generally, the
options have various vesting periods, which include immediate and term vesting periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2002, the Company&#146;s stockholders authorized an additional 2,000,000 shares available for grant

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;8, 2005, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved the CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan (the &#147;Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) at the Company&#146;s 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
In connection with the shares that can be issued under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company filed
a registration statement on Form S-8. The Stock Incentive Plan replaced the Plan. No new grants
will be granted under the Plan. Grants that were made under the Plan prior to the stockholders&#146;
approval of the Stock Incentive Plan will continue to be administered under the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee is authorized to grant awards to
non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees of, and consultants and advisors to,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and to determine the number and types of such awards and the
terms, conditions, vesting and other limitations applicable to each such award. In addition, the
Compensation Committee has the power to interpret the Stock Incentive Plan and to adopt such rules
and regulations as it considers necessary or appropriate for purposes of administering the Stock
Incentive Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following types of awards or any combination of them may be granted under the Stock Incentive
Plan: (i)&nbsp;incentive stock options, (ii)&nbsp;non-qualified stock options, (iii)&nbsp;stock grants, and (iv)
performance awards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The maximum number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock with respect to which awards may be granted to
any individual participant under the Stock Incentive Plan during each of the Company&#146;s fiscal years
will not exceed 1,500,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, subject to certain adjustments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The aggregate number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock that are reserved for awards, including
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying stock options, to be granted under the Stock Incentive
Plan is 6,000,000 shares, subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalizations and other
specified events. If any outstanding award is cancelled, forfeited, or surrendered to the Company,
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock allocable to such award may again be available for awards under the
Stock Incentive Plan. Incentive stock options may be granted only to participants who are
executive officers and other employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the day of the
grant, and non-qualified stock options may be granted to any participant in the Stock Incentive
Plan. No stock option granted under the Stock Incentive Plan will be exercisable later than ten
years after the date it is granted. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, there were no options
to purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock granted under the Stock Incentive Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2008, there were options to purchase 4,422,782 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
outstanding consisting of 4,142,782 Plan and Stock Incentive Plan options and 280,000 Outside Plan
Stock Options. There were options to purchase 2,840,799 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock that were
exercisable as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 plus 280,000 Outside Plan Stock Options.

and December&nbsp;31, 2007 is $115,638 and $164,597, respectively, of stock-based compensation.
Stock-based compensation expenses are recorded in the Corporate Allocation segment as these amounts
are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form option
valuation model (Black-Scholes-Merton formula) that uses the assumptions noted in the table below.
Because closed-form valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those ranges are
disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from historical volatility of
the Company&#146;s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
termination within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical
exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options
granted is derived from general practices used by other companies in the software industry and
estimates by the Company of the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had sales to a single customer
aggregating $3,533,571 (16% of total revenues) and $4,220,835 (20% of total revenues),
respectively. Such customer represents 18% and 21% of software sales, service fee and license fee
revenues for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company had receivables
from this single customer of $267,707 (10% of trade accounts receivable, net) and $411,796 (13% of
the trade accounts receivable, net) as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively.
The contract with this customer contains an automatic annual renewal provision renewed
automatically in March; however, such agreement does contain a 120-day advance notice termination
provision. The contract with this customer was renewed in March&nbsp;2009. The loss of this customer
would have a substantial negative impact on the Company.

purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (&#147;Common Stock&#148;) of the Company in consideration for
securing the issuance of a $2.6&nbsp;million letter of credit (the &#147;Letter of Credit&#148;) from SEB Bank to

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching a
reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company&#146;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (&#147;Internal Control&#148;) to determine whether
any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter (the Company&#146;s fourth fiscal quarter in
the case of an annual report) that have materially affected or which are reasonably likely to
materially affect Internal Control. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during
the quarter covered by this report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary its
procedures and controls.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The management of CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f). The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company&#146;s management and board of directors regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)&nbsp;in <I>Internal
Control-Integrated Framework</I>. Based on the Company&#146;s assessment, it believes that, as of December
31, 2008, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company&#146;s registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management&#146;s report was not
subject to attestation by the Company&#146;s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only
management&#146;s report in this annual report.
