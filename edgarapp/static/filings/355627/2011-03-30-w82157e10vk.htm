Internet-based customer self-care for wireline, wireless and convergent providers of
telecommunications services. EIM software and services are used primarily by telecommunications
services providers to enhance their customer relationships while reducing the providers&#146;
operational expenses related to paper-based invoice delivery and customer support relating to

are able to electronically invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the
enterprise customers to improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications
expenses while reducing the resource investment required to process, validate, approve, and pay
their telecommunication invoices. The Company has historically marketed its EIM products and
services in North America and Europe directly to telecommunication service providers who then
market and distribute the product to their enterprise customers, which consist primarily of
businesses, government agencies and institutions. The Company actively markets EIM products and

</TABLE>
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Competition and integration continue to reshape the communications industry. Continued downward
pressure on prices is driven by strong competition, the continued replacement of wireline services
with wireless alternatives, the introduction of new technologies based on internet protocol (&#147;IP&#148;)
including VoIP, video, and merger and acquisition activities of key service providers. As a
result of such pricing pressures, the Company has been required to reduce its pricing and achieve
product revenue growth through increased volume sales or processing of call detail records.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The industry dynamics noted above are expected to present opportunities for the Company&#146;s software
and service offerings. As service provider margins decline, the Company believes that it continues
to deliver a value message that demonstrates how its EIM and Telemanagement solutions create
competitive differentiation, stronger customer relationships, enhanced lifetime value and increased
operational efficiencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following market drivers are consistent across the telecommunications industry segments
targeted by the Company. Each of these drivers is expected to positively impact the Company&#146;s
growth strategies and the Company&#146;s strategic business positioning. The following trends are
concurrent and are predicted to enhance the growing demand for the enhanced invoice delivery, and
processing capabilities provided by the Company&#146;s EIM products and services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Convergence and Complexity. </I>The nature, size, needs and complexity of the telecommunications
industry continue to change. Consolidation and service expansion continue to narrow the playing
field in the Tier 1 service provider segment that includes Verizon Communications, Inc., Sprint
Nextel Corporation and AT&#038;T Inc. Opportunity exists within the Tier 1 segment but is not the
primary focus of the Company. Broad opportunities exist in the smaller Tier 2, 3 and 4 market
segments that include the regional, niche, and smaller markets. Expanded/bundled service offerings
(local and long distance, voice and data, wireline and wireless, broadband DSL and cable-based
access) are valued by end customers but add significant complexity to the customer/provider
relationship. The industry has evolved around the Integrated Communications Provider (&#147;ICP&#148;) model.
Many service providers are achieving or have developed their ICP model via acquisition and
third-party resale. The Company&#146;s EIM and Telemanagement software and services enable the ICPs to
deliver a viable, integrated and converged experience to their customers &#151; even if the providers&#146;
internal systems and infrastructure may not yet support such integration.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Customer Relationship Management. </I>The Internet continues to redefine the relationship between
service providers and their customers. The industry has invested significant capital in an attempt
to streamline its interaction with customers and prospects alike. Service providers and industry
analysts view web-enabled customer self-care as the key to reducing costs by transitioning many
service and support functions directly to customers. A provider who successfully migrates customer
support functions onto the Web and into the hands of the customer consistently drives down costs,
drives up profits and increases customer satisfaction by enabling the customer to save time,
enhance convenience, and create the customer&#146;s own &#147;personalized&#148; user experience. Adoption and
use of the tools extended by service providers has been disappointing. By delivering a compelling
process and cost advantage to enterprise customers, the Company believes it can drive adoption and
improve the return on investment for service providers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Customer Ownership. </I>Managing the life cycle and maximizing the return from, and retention of,
customers are increasingly recognized to be more important than to simply focus on acquiring more
customers. In an industry experiencing increased acquisition costs, accelerating customer
turnover, and declining margins, it is vital to focus on retention and revenue per customer.
Service providers are seeking options enabling competitive differentiation in service delivery,
product bundling and customer self-care. The Company&#146;s electronic invoice presentment platform
strengthens the service provider&#146;s competitive position while optimizing key operational costs
involving customer care and paper billing fulfillment.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Outsource/Service Bureau. </I>The providers in the telecommunications industry today are demonstrating
increasing interest in establishing third party relationships that add value to their product
portfolio while allowing the provider to focus on its core competencies. The
outsourcing/Application Service Provider (&#147;ASP&#148;) delivery model represents an alternative to the
risks and costs associated with rapidly changing technologies. Service providers are migrating
from in-house development to packaged vendor solutions. At no time in their history has
competition been so prevalent and the need to extend service portfolios so important. Companies
are seeking rapid systems acquisition and implementation from outside parties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Single Vendor Relationships. </I>As competition continues to intensify across virtually every
communications segment, carriers and service providers are looking to their billing and customer
management infrastructure as one of the key differentiators. The industry is moving toward vendor
relationships that can offer integrated solutions. Critical to this requirement are speed of
implementation, scalability, modularity, and seamless integration with other critical business
support systems. As the global telecommunications market continues to evolve, end customers will
be drawn to service providers who not only offer a broad array of services but who will enable them
to see all telecommunication expenditures from a single point of contact (&#147;360&#186; Visibility&#148;).
Whether established incumbents or new market entrants, telecommunications providers require systems
that allow all services to be bundled together into value plans that encourage customer retention
and adoption of additional services. Furthermore, providers require customer management systems
that enable increasingly complex customer relationships to be managed through a unified,
user-friendly interface into the customer database.

performance delivered by CTI create lasting relationships. CTI&#146;s relationship with its largest
customers has spanned more than a decade. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the
Company had sales to a single customer aggregating $2,413,325 (16% of revenues) and $2,849,514 (18%
of revenues), respectively. Such customer represented 16% and 18% of software sales, service fee
and license fee revenues for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
contract with this customer contains an automatic annual renewal provision renewable in March of
each year; however, such agreement also contains a 120-day advance notice termination provision.
The decline in revenue from this customer relates to the cancellation by the customer of several
accounts that were under the service minimums. The contract with this customer was renewed in March
2011. The loss of this customer would have a substantial negative impact on the Company&#146;s
operations and financial condition. There are three EIM customers that totaled $5,218,466 (54% of
EIM revenues) and $5,645,035 (55% of EIM revenues) for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. A loss of any of these customers would have a negative impact on the EIM segment and
CTI as a whole. Generally, the Company enters into multi-year service provider contracts which

be able to recover the personal expenditures on such services, appropriately manage the tax
consequences, and accomplish this without incurring an increase in overhead and administration

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CTI generates revenue through service bureau contracts, software licensing agreements and
maintenance agreements supporting licensed software. Maintenance agreements are either on a time
and material basis or full service agreements that are generally for a period of 1&nbsp;year. For
software licensing agreements on a direct distribution basis, payment terms are a 50% deposit upon
receipt of order and the 50% balance upon installation, which is normally completed within 10&nbsp;days.
Occasionally, larger software orders may require up to 3&nbsp;months to complete, custom software
development and installation. For software licensing via distributor channels, payment terms are
net 30&nbsp;days. Service bureau contracts provide monthly recurring revenue. Generally, contracts of
12 to 36&nbsp;months carry automatic 12-month renewals until canceled. CTI purchases data collection
devices specifically designed for use with telecommunications switches and other hardware such as
modems as are necessary to perform the telemanagement business. CTI rents or resells such
equipment to end-users.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As voice and data services continue to commoditize, the Company anticipates that service providers
will be seeking alternative business models to replace revenue lost directly as a result of pricing
pressures. The Company believes that one such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted
voice and video services. The Company&#146;s VoIP segment designs, develops and provides software and
services that enable managed and hosted customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and
data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform administration and back office functions
such as cost allocation or client bill back. Although the Company has seen what it believes to be
positive results in its VoIP segment, due to the recent U.S. recession and unstable global economy,
the growth has been slower than the Company anticipated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first being that organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second being that the
capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and ARPU advantage possible by delivering such managed and hosted service
offerings, providers not only look at acquiring new customers but converting legacy customers onto
the NGN platform. This conversion process, while potentially producing marked financial results
for a service provider, is not trivial. Many legacy features and functions are not available on
NGN platforms, primarily due to the immaturity of the service delivery model.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications are intended to eliminate customer resistance to conversion to NGN
platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the delivery of
compelling value added services. The Company primarily markets two applications, emPulse and
SmartRecord<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP. These applications enable managed and hosted service customers of service
providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform
administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back. These
applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade products. Customers can
purchase these products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The
Company has taken the business benefits of these enterprise-grade applications and has delivered
provider-grade managed and hosted service applications intended to enable service providers to
create a new recurring revenue stream, while ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools
necessary and relevant to their particular line of business or vertical.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CTI owns two patents which cover a method and process to prepare, display, and analyze usage and
cost information for services including, but not limited to, telecommunications, financial card
services, and utilities (e.g., electricity, oil, gas, water). The patents expire in 2011. The
information can be provided to a user in an advantageous format that allows the user to quickly and
easily retrieve, display, and analyze the information. The systems covered by these patents enable
customer data to be sorted and processed in a manner so that the customer&#146;s generation of reports
is much faster than using a non-patented method. This patented technology is incorporated in the
Company&#146;s SmartBill<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> product. Other companies have developed programs to replicate this patented
process that the Company believes violate its patents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s patent enforcement activities involve the licensing, protection, enforcement and
defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights. The Company has instituted a marketing
approach for patent enforcement activities whereby the Company, in certain cases, actively pursues
a licensing arrangement with violators rather than litigation. The nature of patent enforcement
activities can require the Company to incur significant costs without realization of revenue until
subsequent future periods.

successful in certain instances in enforcing its patents. Patent enforcement revenues of $139,232
were recognized in 2010. As a matter of course, the defense of an outstanding lawsuit attacks the
validity of the patents. The Company does not anticipate that such attack will be successful but
the results of litigation are difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that the Company
will continue to be successful in enforcing its patents in the future or potentially be defeated in
its enforcement activities, which could then jeopardize the successful future enforcement
activities. Since patent enforcement activities require significant outlay for professional legal
costs, the Company anticipates it will undertake future enforcement activities under contingency
arrangements with legal counsel. Except for legal out of pocket expenses, legal professional fees
are typically payable upon successful recoveries. See Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>EIM</I>. The delivery of multiple telecommunications services from a single provider requires the
service provider to present a single and comprehensive view of all of its services to the end
customer. Prior to the release of SmartBill<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Connect, the Company&#146;s value message to
the service provider focused on supporting the provider&#146;s enterprise customers who had complex
service mixes and difficult to manage billing hierarchies. As such, the Company competed in a very
narrowly defined niche. The Company found itself competing against electronic bill presentment and
payment providers whose web-based solutions were positioned as a single solution that could support
large users while delivering presentment and payment to the entire spectrum of end customers. With

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">it is now able to compete directly with providers of electronic billing analysis and with providers
of electronic bill presentment solutions. This combination positions the Company as a provider of
electronic invoice management that delivers content-and-capability bundles that are defined
differently for different market segments.

competitors may be larger and better capitalized than CTI. However, several telecommunications
companies offer a similar product using in-house resources. The Company&#146;s main source of
differentiation from its competitors, in the EIM segment is its technology. The Company has two
patents on its SmartBill<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> and SmartBill<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Connect processes. These patents enable customer data to

competitors of SmartRecord<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP include Telrex, Nice-Systems Ltd., and Orecx. emPulse competes

geopolitical economic and business conditions, conditions in the financial services markets, and
changes in the overall demand for networking products. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn

postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The recent economic crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the uncertainty
in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of
liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in credit, equity, currency and fixed
income markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from these economic developments and
negative economic trends on our business, including the inability of customers to obtain credit to
finance purchases of our products; customer insolvencies; decreased customer confidence to make
purchasing decisions; decreased customer demand; and decreased customer ability to pay their trade
obligations. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow funds in a tightening credit market from
financial institutions to fund future investing and operating activities which will prevent future
growth

automatic annual renewal provision effective each March, it does contain a 120-day prior

beneficially owned 77.2% of the outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. These stockholders can exercise
significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
directors and the approval of major corporate transactions. Such concentration of ownership may
also delay or prevent a change in control of us.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March&nbsp;11, 2011, the closing price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock was $0.09. Our Class&nbsp;A common
stock is a &#147;penny stock&#148; security under the rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. In accordance
with these rules, broker-dealers participating in certain transactions involving penny stocks must
first deliver a disclosure document that describes, among other matters, the risks associated with
trading in penny stocks. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must make a suitability determination
approving the customer for penny stock transactions based on the customer&#146;s financial situation,
investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these determinations in
writing to the customer and obtain specific written consent from the customer. The effect of these
restrictions will probably decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market in our Class
A common stock, decrease liquidity of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and increase transaction costs for
sales and purchases of our Class&nbsp;A common stock as compared to other securities.

respectively. The Company leases 15,931 square feet of office space in Indianapolis for an average
of $257,643 per year. The Indianapolis lease expires in February&nbsp;2014. The Company leased 3,485
square feet of office space near London in the United Kingdom at an annual rate equivalent
approximately to $70,000 per annum. The London lease expires in December&nbsp;2013; however, it can be
cancelled without penalty with a six month advance notice. The Company leased 9,360 square feet of
office space in Blackburn in the United Kingdom at an annual rate equivalent of approximately
$115,000. The Blackburn lease expires December&nbsp;2011. The Company intends to renew the Blackburn
lease but if the lease is not renewed, the Company anticipates that comparable space can be leased
in Blackburn or surrounding areas. The Company believes that, although its facilities are adequate
to meet its current level of sales, additional space may be required to support future growth.

its claim construction for U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. On January&nbsp;18, 2008, the Qwest entities
filed a motion for stay and a summary judgment motion of invalidity based on the construction of
one of the claim terms. The motions were fully briefed on an expedited basis and on February&nbsp;26,
2008, the court denied the motions. Fact discovery closed on December&nbsp;23, 2008. Expert discovery
was completed on April&nbsp;1, 2009. On April&nbsp;15, 2009, the parties filed various summary judgment
motions related to patent infringement and invalidity and immunity from suit concerning the Networx
government contracts. On September&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court granted the Qwest entities&#146; motion for
summary judgment of immunity from suit concerning the Networx government contracts, thereby
requiring the Company to sue the Government in the Court of Federal Claims. On October&nbsp;29, 2009,
the Court ruled on the parties&#146; patent invalidity and noninfringement summary judgment motions. The
Court held that the Company&#146;s U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270 was valid but not infringed by the Qwest
entities. In November&nbsp;2009, the Company filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). The Qwest entities subsequently cross appealed.
Briefing before the Federal Circuit was completed, and, on January&nbsp;20, 2011, the Federal Circuit
reversed the district court&#146;s decision. On February&nbsp;22, 2011, the Qwest entities filed a Petition
for a Rehearing en banc. If the Federal Circuit&#146;s decision remains unchanged following the court&#146;s
disposition of Qwest&#146;s petition or a petition for certiorari review to the U.S. Supreme Court (if
Qwest elects to seek such review), the case will return to the district court for trial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Qwest Corporation filed a motion in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana seeking to dismiss the complaint against it on jurisdictional grounds or, alternatively, to
transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The
parties then engaged in jurisdictional discovery. On February&nbsp;14, 2005, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Indiana denied the motion as moot.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2005, an anonymous request for reexamination of the Company&#146;s U. S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270 was
filed with the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO). The Company suspects that such request was filed as a
tactical matter from one or more of the aforementioned defendants. The Company believes that the
request for reexamination is without merit. In May of 2006, the USPTO issued a Notice of Intent to
Issue Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate. Subsequent to that time, the Company has submitted
numerous additional documents for consideration by the USPTO, the last such filing being in January
2009. On December&nbsp;29, 2009, the USPTO issued an Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate confirming all
of the claims of the Company&#146;s U. S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On May&nbsp;13, 2005, Qwest Corporation, Qwest International and Qwest Communications Corporation filed

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagment (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute such software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications expenses while driving
internal efficiencies into their invoice receipt, validation, approval and payment workflow
processes. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor
communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or
client bill back. These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade
products. Customers typically purchase the VoIP products when upgrading or acquiring a new
enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection,
enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates its revenues and cash from several sources: software sales, license fees,
processing fees, implementation fees, training and consulting services, and enforcement revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s software products and services are subject to changing technology and evolving
customer needs which require the Company to continually invest in research and development in order
to respond to these demands. The limited financial resources available to the Company require the
Company to concentrate on those business segments and product lines which the Company believes will
provide the greatest returns on investment. The EIM segment, as compared to the other business
segments, provides the predominant share of income from operations and cash flow from operations.
The majority of revenues from the Telemanagement segment are derived from the Company&#146;s United
Kingdom operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that as voice and data services continue to commoditize, service providers
will seek alternative business models to replace revenue lost as a result of pricing pressures.
One such alternative business model is the delivery of managed or hosted voice and video services.
Although the Company has seen what it believes to be positive results in its VoIP segment, due to
the recent U.S. recession and unstable global economy, the growth has been slower than anticipated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first disadvantage is organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second disadvantage is
the capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and average revenue per user advantage possible by delivering such
managed and hosted service offerings, providers not only look to acquire new customers but to
convert legacy customers onto the NGN platform. The Company believes that this conversion process
could be significant. Many legacy

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">features and functions are not available on NGN platforms, primarily due to the immaturity of the
service delivery model.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications will help eliminate customer resistance to conversion to next
generation platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the
delivery of compelling value added services. In 2007, the Company marketed two applications,
emPulse, web-based communications traffic analysis solution, and SmartRecord<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP, which enable
service providers to selectively intercept communications on behalf of their hosted and managed
service customers. These applications will also enable managed and hosted service customers of
service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor communications, and
perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back.
These applications were released as enterprise-grade products. The Company anticipates that
customers will purchase these products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications
platform. The Company has taken the business benefits of these enterprise-grade applications and
has delivered provider-grade managed and hosted service applications, enabling service providers to
create a new recurring revenue stream, while ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools
necessary and relevant to their particular line of business or vertical. Due to the recent U.S.
recession and unstable global economy, the growth in the VoIP market has been slower than the
Company anticipated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial Condition</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, the stockholders&#146; equity decreased $3,305,353 from
$8,536,147 as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 to $5,230,794 as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 primarily as a result of
the fiscal year 2010 net loss of $3,328,115. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents were
$680,046 compared to $508,836 at December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company realized a decrease in net current
assets (current assets less current liabilities) of approximately $97 which was primarily
attributable to increases in advances from a shareholder and deferred revenue offset by the
increased cash and trade receivables.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates approximately 69% of its revenues from operations in the United Kingdom where
the functional currency is the United Kingdom pound. Revenues derived from operations in the United
Kingdom were negatively impacted in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to the reduction in the average
conversion rate. The average conversion rate for the United Kingdom pound into a United States
dollar for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 was 1.54 compared to 1.56 for the year ended December
31, 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from operations decreased $508,710 to $15,236,306 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as
compared to $15,745,016 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. Decreased revenues in 2010 were
experienced by the EIM and Telemanagement segments offset by increases in the VoIP and Patent
Enforcement segments. The EIM segment revenue decreased $584,696 primarily due to reduced
processing revenue from the Company&#146;s largest EIM customer. Telemanagement revenue decreased
$466,852 to $4,544,245 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $5,011,097 for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decrease in Telemanagement segment revenue was due to a decline in new
systems installed in the United Kingdom. Revenue from the VoIP segment was $929,378 for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 which represents an increase of $403,606 compared to $525,772 of revenue
recognized in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Patent Enforcement Segment recorded $139,232
of revenue in 2010 as compared to no revenue recorded in 2009. One major customer represented 16%
of total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 18% of total revenues for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009, and such customer represented 16% and 18% of software sales, service fee and
license fee revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009,
respectively.

services, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $387,307 primarily due to costs
related to the increase in revenue. The Telemanagement segment cost of products and services,
excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased $221,212 primarily due to costs related to the
decrease in revenue. For software sales, service fee and license fee revenues, the cost of
products and services, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 32.1% of revenue for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 as compared to 28.0% of revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The
increase in the percentage was primarily due to an increase in professional services in the EIM
segment and a reduction of revenue.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Patent license fee and enforcement cost for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 decreased by $922,519
to $3,754 as compared to $926,273 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decrease was primarily
due to the increased level of legal expenses for the Company&#146;s outside counsel in 2010 in
connection with certain patent enforcement activities.

2010 compared to $2,495,367 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decrease in expense was
primarily due to an increase of $159,690 in development costs that were allocated to cost of
products due to increased developer time being spent on customer specific projects and new
installations. The amount of capitalized development costs related to internally developed
software for resale was $672,545 and $1,092,963 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Research and development expense relates primarily to personnel costs.

for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $1,575,209 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. This
increase was primarily due to the amortization expense associated with VoIP and EIM internally
developed software. Approximately $719,472 and $600,345 of amortization expense was related to
capitalized software costs for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company records a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset to the extent
management believes, it is more likely than not, that the asset will not be realized. At December
31, 2010, the Company provided a valuation allowance against the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets of
the Company&#146;s net operating loss carryforwards in the United States net of certain deferred tax
liabilities. Given profitability from operations in the United Kingdom, the deferred tax assets
related to the United Kingdom operations do not have a valuation allowance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The net tax expense of $68,253 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 was primarily attributable to
the earnings before tax of $24,084 realized from the Company&#146;s United Kingdom operations. The
goodwill impairment charge of $2,127,401 is not recognized in the determination of UK taxes. The
net tax expense of $262,719 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was primarily attributable to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Historically, the Company&#146;s principal need for funds has been for operating activities (including
costs of products and services, patent enforcement activities, selling, general and administrative
expenses, research and development, and working capital needs), and capital expenditures, including
software development. Cash flows from operations and existing cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments have been adequate to meet our business objectives. Cash, cash equivalents,
and short-term investments increased by $171,210 to $680,046 as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $508,836
as of December&nbsp;31, 2009<I>. </I>Cash provided by operations was $596,105, cash used in investing activity
was $795,344, and cash provided by financing activities was $387,614 for the year ended December
31, 2010. Cash flow provided by operations of $596,105 was primarily attributable to the Company&#146;s
add back of non-cash goodwill impairment of $2,127,401 and depreciation and amortization of
$1,666,573 which partially off-set the net loss of $3,328,115. Cash flows used in investing
activities of $795,344 related primarily to capitalized costs incurred in the development and
enhancements of the Company&#146;s products. Cash flows provided by financing activities of $387,614
was attributable to the amount borrowed from the Company&#146;s majority shareholder partially off-set
by payments made on the Company&#146;s credit agreements. Cash generated from income from operations of
the Telemanagement and Patent Enforcement segments of $484,271 and $135,125, respectively, was
off-set by cash used in the EIM and VoIP segments of $253,315 and $2,459,066 and Corporate expenses
of $1,048,521.

United Kingdom and a loss of $3,167,670 for the United States. The Company anticipates that its
cash needs will be met during the next twelve months primarily through cash from operations of the
Company&#146;s EIM segment in the United States and the United Kingdom. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the
Company did not and as of the date of this Form 10-K does not have a credit facility in place.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 of $3,328,115 was primarily due to
the goodwill impairment charge of $2,127,401 and losses realized by the VoIP segment. The loss
before taxes realized from the VoIP segment for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $2,459,377.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 of $1,333,376 was primarily due to
losses realized by the VoIP segment. The loss from operations realized from the VoIP segment for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $2,721,252.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a single EIM customer. For the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had sales to this single customer aggregating
$2,413,325 (16% of total revenues) and $2,849,514 (18% of total revenues), respectively. Such
customer represented 16% and 18% of software sales, service fee and license fee revenues for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company had receivables from this single
customer of $182,991 (6% of trade accounts receivable, net) and $213,254 (9% of the trade accounts
receivable, net) as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively. The contract with
this customer contains an automatic annual renewal provision renewed automatically in March;
however, such agreement does contain a 120-day advance notice termination provision. The contract
with this customer was renewed in March&nbsp;2011. The loss of this customer would have a substantial
negative impact on the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company had the following debt obligations (&#147;Loan Agreements&#148;):
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2006, the Company had available a revolving loan with PNC Bank (&#147;PNC&#148;), formerly National
City Bank, equal to the lesser of (a) $8,000,000, or (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic trade
accounts receivable, 90% of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable and 100% of cash
placed in a restricted account (the &#147;Revolving Loan&#148;). All borrowings are collateralized by
substantially all assets of the Company. On November&nbsp;13, 2007, the Company and PNC amended the
revolving loan to reduce the available amount that could be advanced under the Loan Agreement to
$3,000,000 and to remove the cash placed in a restricted account. Effective November&nbsp;18, 2008, the
Company and PNC entered into a Second Modification of Loan Documents (the &#147;Second Modification&#148;).
The Second Modification reduced the amount of the $2,600,000 acquisition loan (the &#147;Acquisition
Loan&#148;) entered into with PNC to $500,000 upon the Company&#146;s prepayment of $2.1&nbsp;million of the
Acquisition Loan. The Second Modification also modified the terms of the Revolving Loan to state
that the sum of (a)&nbsp;advances made on the Revolving Loan, and (b)&nbsp;any Company debt that is not
secured by cash or a letter of credit, may not exceed four times the trailing twelve (12)&nbsp;month
consolidated EBITDA as defined in the agreement. The revolving loan expired on December&nbsp;30, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2010, in order to supplement the Company&#146;s liquidity, Fairford advanced to the Company
$500,000. Subsequent to the advancement, the Company issued to Fairford a demand note, in the
aggregate principal amount of $500,000 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 4%. The demand note has no
term and is due on demand. The Company intends to seek a replacement revolving loan facility. If
the Company is not successful in obtaining a replacement revolving loan facility, it will seek
additional funds from Fairford. There can be no guarantee that Fairford will provide additional
funding to the Company, if needed, or that the Company will be successful in obtaining a
replacement revolving loan facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreement allowed for repayment to be made within ten days of the maturity date before a

Subsequent to the advancement and approval by the board of directors, the Company issued to
Fairford a demand note, in the aggregate principal amount of $825,000 bearing interest at LIBOR
plus 4%. The demand note has no term and is due on demand.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition and accounts receivable reserves, depreciation and amortization, investments, income
taxes, capitalized software, accrued compensation, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Income Taxes. </I>The Company is required to estimate its income taxes. This process involves
estimating the Company&#146;s actual current tax obligations together with assessing differences
resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with
accounting guidance for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or
liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these
differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are assessed each reporting period as to whether it is more
likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income, including assumptions
regarding on-going tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is
uncertain, the Company will establish a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be
recovered. Changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax
provision in the statement of operations.

assets related to the United Kingdom operations do not have a valuation allowance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with accounting guidance. A
tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the tax position
would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The
amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than not&#148; test, no tax
benefit is recorded.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Goodwill and Intangible Assets. </I>Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between
annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. There was an impairment of
$2,127,401 in 2010 and no impairment in 2009. Goodwill was impaired due to a decrease in
forecasted performance in CTI Billing Solutions Limited. Purchased intangible assets other than
goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite.
Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is
computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally 3-15&nbsp;years.
Intangible assets consist of patents, purchased technology, trademarks and trade names, and
customer lists.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company considers the goodwill and related intangible assets related to CTI Billing Solutions

functional currency with respect to these assets the U.S. dollar.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s goodwill and significant component of its intangible assets relate to CTI Billing
Solutions Limited. That entity is considered a separate reporting unit under accounting guidance
and the Company performed its annual impairment analysis on goodwill as of the October&nbsp;1, 2010 to
coincide with the calendar date set in past years for this analysis. The Company&#146;s analysis
considered the projected cash flows of the reporting unit and gave consideration to appropriate
factors in determining a discount rate to be applied to these cash flows. The Company engaged the
same outside firm as was used in past years to assist in this analysis. The Company is satisfied as
to the qualifications and independence of this firm with respect to their ability to assist in this
analysis. The results of this analysis indicated that there was an impairment of $2,127,140 as of
our assessment date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Coincident with the decline in the overall stock market, the price of the Company&#146;s common stock

Company&#146;s stock was approximately $2.6&nbsp;million which is well below the Company&#146;s reported book
value at December&nbsp;31, 2010 of approximately $5.2&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the significant decline in the Company&#146;s stock price, the Company reviewed the

an overall lack of public awareness of its operations. While the Company cannot quantify the impact
of these factors in terms of how they impact the difference between book value and our stock&#146;s

disposal of long-lived assets, the Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its
long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives. Long-lived assets are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying
amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates
there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future
cash flows.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Reserves. </I>The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policy is
consistent with accounting guidance on revenue recognition. In general, the Company records
revenue when it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from software licenses are
recognized upon shipment, delivery or customer acceptance, based on the substance of the
arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor
obligations to be fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured. Software sales revenue is
generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new
applications to existing customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in accounting guidance for software
revenue recognition Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training, consulting, and customization are
recognized as provided to customers. If the services are essential to the functionality of the
software, revenue from the software component is deferred until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth accounting
guidance. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the entire arrangement is accounted
for in conformity with guidance related to long-term construction-type contracts, using the
relevant guidance for accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production-type
contracts. The Company carefully evaluates the circumstances surrounding the implementations to
determine whether the percentage-of-completion method or the completed-contract method should be
used. Most implementations relate to the Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in
less than 30&nbsp;days once the work begins. The Company uses the completed-contract method on
contracts that will be completed within 30&nbsp;days since it produces a result similar to the
percentage-of-completion method. On contracts that will take over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company
uses the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting.

any specific customer collection issues that the Company has identified. If the financial condition

additional allowances may be required. Where an allowance for doubtful accounts has been
established with respect to customer receivables, as payments are made on such receivables or if

CTI Group (Holdings) Inc.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and
stockholders&#146; equity and comprehensive income / (loss)&nbsp;for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BUSINESS: </I>CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;CTI&#148;)
design, develop, market and support billing and data management software and services. The Company
operates in four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management, Telemanagement, Voice over
Internet Protocol and Patent Enforcement Activities. The majority of the Company&#146;s business is in
North America and Europe.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s future operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could
affect future operating results and cause actual results to vary from historical results include,
but are not limited to: adverse economic conditions, risks associated with doing business outside
the United States, significant foreign currency fluctuations, restrictive loan covenants,
impairments may be recorded on intangibles, loss of its significant customers, inability to enhance
existing products and services to meet the evolving needs of customers, the Company&#146;s inability to
compete successfully, failure to enforce intellectual property rights, damage done to relationships
with potential customers by the Company&#146;s attempt to enforce intellectual property rights, the
Company&#146;s inability to successfully enter new markets, the Company&#146;s inability to maintain an
effective system of internal controls, control of the Company&#146;s stock is concentrated among
directors and officers, the Company is subject to penny stock rules which may adversely affect
trading of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, and there is not presently an active market for the
Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</I>: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;).
The FASB establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;) that
the Company follows. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(&#147;SEC&#148;) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
registrants, which the Company is required to follow. References to GAAP issued by the FASB in
these footnotes are to the FASB <I>Accounting Standards Codification </I>(&#147;ASC&#148;), which serves as a single
source of authoritative non-SEC accounting and reporting standards to be applied by nongovernmental
entities. The FASB finalized the ASC effective for periods ending on or after September&nbsp;15, 2009.
Prior FASB standards like FASB Statement of Accounting Standards and FASB Staff Positions are no
longer being issued by the FASB. For further discussion of the ASC, see &#147;New Accounting
Pronouncements&#148; in Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations elsewhere in the Form 10-K.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION</I>: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company&#146;s wholly owned United Kingdom-based subsidiaries. The financial statements of the
Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements and have
been translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting guidance on foreign currency
translation. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates in effect at the consolidated
balance sheet date and stockholders&#146; equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue
and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the applicable period. Any resulting
translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive income. Included in
selling, general and administrative expenses is a transaction loss of approximately $42,000 for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and a transaction gain of approximately $17,000 for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS</I>: Cash and cash equivalents include the cash on hand, demand deposits and
highly liquid investments. The Company considers all highly liquid investments, with maturity of
three months or less, to be cash equivalents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>ADVERTISING COSTS: </I>The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, advertising expense was $156,845 and $170,367, respectively.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt">CTI GROUP (HOLDINGS)&nbsp;INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES<BR>
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>USE OF ESTIMATES</I>: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates utilized by the Company include the
determination of the collectibility of receivables, valuation of stock options, recoverability
and/or impairment of intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, accrued compensation and
other liabilities, commitments and contingencies, and capitalization and impairment of computer
software development costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</I>: The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist primarily of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, note and settlement receivables, accounts payable,
accrued expenses, and debt payable. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, the book values of these
financial instruments are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to
the short maturity of these instruments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: </I>Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Furniture,
fixtures and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of three to five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of the lease or the useful lives of the
improvements, whichever is shorter. All maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as
incurred.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</I>: Expenditures for producing product masters incurred subsequent to establishing
technological feasibility are capitalized and are amortized on a product-by-product basis ranging
from three to four years. The amortization is computed using the greater of (a)&nbsp;the straight-line
method over the estimated economic life of the product or (b)&nbsp;the ratio that the current gross
revenue for the products bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue of the
products. The accounting guidance requires the periodic evaluation of the net realizable value of
capitalized computer software costs. The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over
its related net realizable value at a balance sheet date shall be written down. See Note 4 &#151;
Property, Equipment and Software Development Costs. The Company capitalized $672,545 and
$1,092,963 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in costs related to its
software development. The amortization expense for developed software which relates to cost of
sales was $719,472 and $600,345 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: </I>The Company considers the goodwill and related intangible assets
related to CTI Billing Solutions Limited to be the premium the Company paid for CTI Billing
Solutions Limited. For accounting purposes, these assets are maintained at the corporate level and
the Company considers the functional currency with respect to these assets the U.S. dollar.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain
circumstances, and written down when impaired. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment of
$2,127,401 in 2010 and no impairment in 2009. An impairment charge is recognized when the fair
value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. The Company&#146;s fair value was determined using
discounted cash flows and other market-related valuation models. Certain estimates and judgments
are required in the application of the fair value models. Purchased intangible assets other than
goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives unless these lives are
determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated
amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally 3-15&nbsp;years. Intangible assets consist of patents, purchased technology, trademarks and
trade names, and customer lists.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>LONG-LIVED ASSETS</I>: The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived
assets, including intangible assets with definite lives using the methodology prescribed in
accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the
carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison
indicates there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using
discounted expected future cash flows.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS</I>: Costs relating to obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over
the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt.
Interest expense relating to the amortization of the deferred financing costs amounted to $96,131
and $103,671 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>REVENUE RECOGNITION: </I>The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements
set forth in accounting guidance for revenue recognition. In general, the Company records revenue
when it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from software licenses are recognized
upon shipment, delivery or customer acceptance of the software, based on the substance of the
arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor
obligations to be fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured. Software sales revenue is
generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new
applications to existing customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in accounting guidance for software
revenue recognition. Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training, consulting, and customization are
recognized as provided to customers. If the services are essential to the functionality of the
software, revenue from the software component is deferred until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting. If the criteria for
separate accounting are not met, the entire arrangement is accounted for in conformity with
guidance related to long-term construction type contracts. The Company carefully evaluates the
circumstances surrounding the implementations to determine whether the percentage-of-completion
method or the completed-contract method should be used. Most implementations relate to the
Company&#146;s products and are completed in less than 30&nbsp;days once the work begins. The Company uses
the completed-contract method on contracts that will be completed within 30&nbsp;days since it produces
a result similar to the percentage-of-completion method. On contracts that will take over 30&nbsp;days
to complete, the Company uses the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable. In 2008, the Company established a reserve of $206,110 on a note receivable
related to a patent license and enforcement revenues due to the insolvency of the debtor. In 2009,
the Company wrote off the note receivable

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>INCOME TAXES</I>: The Company accounts for income taxes following the accounting guidance for
accounting for income taxes, which requires recording income taxes under the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes
are recognized for the tax consequences of &#147;temporary differences&#148; by applying enacted statutory
tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is recorded based on a determination of the ultimate realizability of net
deferred tax assets. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Uncertain income tax positions are recognized as a benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148;
that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being
presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than
not&#148; test, no tax benefit is recorded.

in accordance with accounting guidance on earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss)&nbsp;per share is
computed by dividing reported earnings (loss)&nbsp;available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss)&nbsp;per share is
computed by dividing reported earnings (loss)&nbsp;available to common stockholders by adjusted weighted
average shares outstanding for the year assuming the exercise of all potentially dilutive stock
options and warrants.

allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does
not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates
the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative
selling price method. The consensus significantly expands the disclosure requirements for
multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis for
revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June
15, 2010, with earlier application permitted. Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU
on a retrospective basis. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-14 &#151; Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
Elements</I>. This ASU removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance and
provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a
tangible product are within the scope of the software revenue model or the guidance in
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables model, ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. Generally, if the software
contained in or part of the arrangement with the tangible product is essential to the tangible
product&#146;s functionality, then the software is excluded from the software revenue guidance. The ASU
also provides factors to consider in evaluating whether the software was essential to the tangible
product or not. The disclosure requirements, effective date, and transition methods for this ASU
are the same as those for ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. An entity must adopt both ASUs in the same period using
the same transition method. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

within Subtopic 855-10. An entity that is an SEC filer is not required to disclose the date through

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Amortization expense on intangible assets amounted to $682,732 and $698,777 for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Goodwill was impaired by $2,127,401 during the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. The goodwill impairment was related to goodwill recognized on the 2006
acquisition of the Company&#146;s EIM Segment in the UK. The impairment was due to two consecutive
years of declining revenues in the UK EIM segment and a corresponding downward revision to forecast
and forecasted cash flows. The fair value of the segment was determined using discounted cash
flows and other market-related valuation models. Certain estimates and judgments are required in
the application of the fair value models. Amortization expense on intangible assets with a
definite life for the next 5&nbsp;years as of December&nbsp;31 is as follows: 2011 &#151; $683,611; 2012 -
$683,611; 2013 &#151; $683,611; 2014 &#151; $679,173; 2015 &#151; $469,271; and thereafter &#151; $0.

respectively. The Company leases 15,931 square feet of office space in Indianapolis for an average
cost of $257,643 per year. The Indianapolis lease expires in February&nbsp;2014. The Company leases
3,485 square feet of office space near London in the United Kingdom at an annual rate equivalent
approximately to $70,000 per annum. The London lease expires in December&nbsp;2013; however, it can be
cancelled without penalty with a six month advance notice. The Company leased 9,360 square feet of
office space in Blackburn in the United Kingdom at an annual rate equivalent to approximately
$115,000. The Blackburn lease expires December&nbsp;2011. The Company believes that, although its
facilities are adequate to meet its current level of sales, additional space may be required to
support future growth. In connection with the Indianapolis lease and the Blackburn lease, the
lessor contributed money for improvements to the leased premises. The amounts contributed for
improvements are being amortized ratably over the life of the lease which reduces the average
annual expense related to the leases.

restricted account. Effective November&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company and PNC entered into a Second
Modification of Loan Documents (the &#147;Second Modification&#148;). The Second Modification reduced the
amount of the $2,600,000 acquisition loan (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;) entered into with PNC to
$500,000 upon the Company&#146;s prepayment of $2.1&nbsp;million of the Acquisition Loan. The Second
Modification also modified the terms of the Revolving Loan to state that the sum of (a)&nbsp;advances
made on the Revolving Loan, and (b)&nbsp;any Company debt that is not secured by cash or a letter of
credit, may not exceed four times the trailing twelve (12)&nbsp;month consolidated EBITDA as defined in
the agreement. The revolving loan expired on December&nbsp;30, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreement allowed for repayment to be made within ten days of the maturity date before a
default in debt would be declared. Outstanding principal under the Loan Agreement amounted to
$825,000 on December&nbsp;30, 2010. On January&nbsp;3, 2011, in order to supplement the Company&#146;s liquidity
which enabled the Company to repay the revolving loan facility with PNC, Fairford Holdings Limited,
a British Virgin Islands company (&#147;Fairford&#148;) advanced $825,000 to the Company. As of December&nbsp;31,
2010, Fairford beneficially owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. On
January&nbsp;20, 2011, the board of directors approved the terms of Fairford&#146;s advancement and the form
of demand note. Subsequent to the advancement and approval by the board of directors, the Company
issued to Fairford a demand note, in the aggregate principal amount of $825,000 bearing interest at
LIBOR plus 4%. The demand note has no term and is due on demand.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is in the process of seeking a replacement revolving loan facility. If the Company is
not successful in obtaining a replacement revolving loan facility, it will seek additional funds
from Fairford. There can be no assurance that Fairford will provide additional funding to the
Company, if needed, or that the Company will be successful in obtaining a replacement revolving
loan facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2010, in order to supplement the Company&#146;s liquidity, Fairford advanced $500,000 to the
Company. Subsequent to the advancement, the Company issued to Fairford a demand note, in the
aggregate principal amount of $500,000 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 4%. The demand note has no
term and is due on demand. The Company intends to seek a replacement revolving loan facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company had negative working capital of $1,420,596 and stockholders&#146;
equity of $5,230,794. Included in current liabilities was deferred revenue of $2,274,870 which
reflects revenue to be recognized in future periods. Therefore, the cash requirements associated
with deferred revenue are expected to be less than the recorded liability.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March
2011, the Company received a purchase order for EIM licenses in the U.K. totaling approximately $6
million in the first quarter of 2011 and expects to receive payment early in the second quarter of
2011. The contract is with an existing customer and the revenue will be
recognized over the term of the three-year contract. The Company believes that this source of liquidity along with the cash on hand, and
anticipated increased cash generated from future operating activities will be sufficient to support
its operations over the next twelve months and to repay the Fairford demand notes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, they would favorably affect the effective income
tax rate in future periods. Consistent with the provisions of accounting guidance for uncertain tax
positions, the Company has classified certain income tax liabilities as current or noncurrent based
on management&#146;s estimate of when these liabilities will be settled.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., the state of Indiana and
other various states and the foreign jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. The Company remains
subject to examination by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions the Company has filed returns for
years after 2005. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to
significantly increase in the next twelve months.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax
expense. The Company accrued for interest and penalties at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company had available unused net operating losses of $9,743,119 and tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $226,806 that may be applied against future taxable income
and that expire from 2017 to 2030. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning in making these assessments. At December&nbsp;31,
2010, the Company had a valuation allowance of $4,119,533 established against the U.S. deferred tax
assets as utilization of these tax assets is not assured in the United States. In addition, at
December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company considered its cumulative earnings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries
to be permanently reinvested.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) provided for
the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase, and restricted stock grants
of, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Individuals eligible for participation in the
Plan included designated officers and other employees (including employees who also serve as
directors), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants who perform services
for the Company. The terms of each grant under the Plan were determined by the Board of Directors,
or a committee of the board administering the Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a change of control of the Company as
in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Stock options granted under the Plan typically become
exercisable over a one to five year period. Generally, the options have various vesting periods,
which include immediate and term vesting periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2002, the Company&#146;s stockholders authorized an additional 2,000,000 shares available for grant
under the Plan. In addition, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the
Securities Exchange Commission. Such registration statement also covered certain options granted
prior to the merger in 2001, which were not granted under the Plan (&#147;Outside Plan Stock Options&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;8, 2005, the Company&#146;s stockholders ratified the CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan (the &#147;Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) at the Company&#146;s 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
In addition, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the Securities Exchange
Commission. The Stock Incentive Plan replaced the Plan. No new grants will be granted under the
Plan. Grants that were made under the Plan prior to the stockholders&#146; approval of the Stock
Incentive Plan will continue to be administered under the Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee is authorized to grant awards to
non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees of, and consultants and advisors to,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and to determine the number and types of such awards and the
terms, conditions, vesting and other limitations applicable to each such award. In addition, the
Compensation Committee has the power to interpret the Stock Incentive Plan and to adopt such rules
and regulations as it considers necessary or appropriate for purposes of administering the Stock
Incentive Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following types of awards or any combination of awards may be granted under the Stock Incentive
Plan: (i)&nbsp;incentive stock options, (ii)&nbsp;non-qualified stock options, (iii)&nbsp;stock grants, and (iv)
performance awards.

any individual participant under the Stock Incentive Plan during each of the Company&#146;s fiscal years
will not exceed 1,500,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, subject to certain adjustments described
in the Stock Incentive Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The aggregate number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock that are reserved for awards, including
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying stock options, to be granted under the Stock Incentive
Plan is 6,000,000 shares, subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalizations and other
specified events. If any outstanding award is cancelled, forfeited, or surrendered to the Company,
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock allocable to such award may again be available for awards under the
Stock Incentive Plan. Incentive stock options may be granted only to participants who are
executive officers and other employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the day of the
grant, and non-qualified stock options may be granted to any participant in the Stock Incentive
Plan. No stock option granted under the Stock Incentive Plan will be exercisable later than ten
years after the date it is granted. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, there were 1,500,000
options to purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock granted under the Stock Incentive Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form option
valuation model (Black-Scholes-Merton formula) that uses the assumptions noted in the table below.
Because closed-form valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those ranges are
disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from historical volatility of
the Company&#146;s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
termination within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical
exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options
granted is derived from general practices used by other companies in the software industry and
estimates by the Company of the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, options to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock were granted at an exercise price of $0.09 per share to each member of the
Company&#146;s board of directors which consisted of Messrs.&nbsp;Birbeck, Garrison, Armitage, Osseiran,
Dahl, Reinarts and Grein. During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, options to purchase
200,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock were granted at an exercise price of $0.08 per
share to Mr.&nbsp;Hanuschek, the Company&#146;s Chief Financial Officer. The options vest ratably over three
years on the anniversary date of the grant.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and a director of the
Company guarantees all of the Company&#146;s debt. The Company incurred a non-cash charge $2,675
related to his guarantee for each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company incurred $58,000 in fees and $22,281 in expenses associated with the Board of Directors
activities in 2010 and $63,000 in fees and approximately $26,303 in expenses associated with the
Board of Directors activities in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2010, in order to supplement the Company&#146;s liquidity, Fairford advanced to the Company
$500,000. Subsequent to the advancement, the Company issued to Fairford a demand note, in the
aggregate principal amount of $500,000 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 4%. The demand note has no
term and is due on demand. The Company intends to seek a replacement revolving loan facility to,
among other things, replace the Fairford demand notes. If the Company is not successful in
obtaining a replacement revolving loan facility, it will seek additional funds from Fairford. There
can be no assurance that Fairford will provide additional funding to the Company, if needed, or
that the Company will be successful in obtaining a replacement revolving loan facility.

Liquidity) matured on December&nbsp;30, 2010. The Loan Agreement, however, allowed for repayment to be
made within ten days of the maturity date before a default in debt would be declared. Outstanding
principal under the Loan Agreement amounted to $825,000 on December&nbsp;30, 2010. On January&nbsp;3, 2011,
in order to supplement the Company&#146;s liquidity which enabled the Company to repay the revolving
loan facility with PNC, Fairford advanced to the Company $825,000. On January&nbsp;20, 2011, the board
of directors approved the terms of Fairford&#146;s advancement and the form of demand note. Subsequent
to the advancement and approval by the board of directors, the Company issued to Fairford a demand
note, in the aggregate principal amount of $825,000 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 4%. The demand

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching a
reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company&#146;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (&#147;Internal Control&#148;) to determine whether
any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter (the Company&#146;s fourth fiscal quarter in
the case of an annual report) that have materially affected or which are reasonably likely to
materially affect Internal Control. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during
the quarter covered by this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary its
procedures and controls.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The management of CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f). The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company&#146;s management and board of directors regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)&nbsp;in <I>Internal
Control-Integrated Framework</I>. Based on the Company&#146;s assessment, it believes that, as of December
31, 2010, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.

accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management&#146;s report was not
subject to attestation by the Company&#146;s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management&#146;s report in
this annual report.
