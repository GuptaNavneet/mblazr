<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s ability to predict projected results or the effect of certain events on the Company&#146;s
operating results is inherently uncertain. Therefore, the Company wishes to caution each reader of
this Quarterly Report to carefully consider the risk factors stated in the Company&#146;s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, any or all of which have in the past and
could in the future affect the ability of the Company to achieve its anticipated results and could
cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein, including, but not limited
to: effects of current economic crisis, ability to attract and retain customers to purchase its
products, ability to develop or launch new software products, technological advances by third
parties and competition, ability to protect the Company&#146;s patented technology, and ability to
obtain settlements in connection with its patent enforcement activities. You should not place
any undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any intent or
obligations to update forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;CTI&#148;) design, develop, market and
support billing and data management software and services. The Company operates in four business
segments: Electronic Invoice Management, Telemanagement, Voice Over Internet Protocol and Patent
Enforcement Activities. The majority of the Company&#146;s business is in North America and Europe.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company was originally incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1968 and reincorporated in the State of
Delaware in 1988, pursuant to a merger of CTI into a wholly owned subsidiary formed as a Delaware
corporation. In November&nbsp;1995, the Company changed its name to CTI Group (Holdings) Inc.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of the following business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagement (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute such software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage their telecommunications expenses while
driving internal efficiencies into their invoice receipt, validation, approval and payment workflow
processes. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor
communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or
client bill back. These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade
products. Customers typically purchase the VoIP products when upgrading or acquiring a new
enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection,
enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights.

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, has been
condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, although the Company
believes the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 and the notes thereto included in the Company&#146;s Form
10-K filed with the SEC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;).
The FASB establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;). Rules
and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) under authority of
federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants, which the
Company is required to follow.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized once
the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable is

finance costs, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, and other accruals approximate
their fair values because of their nature and expected duration. The fair value of the revolving
credit facility and note payable is equal to its carrying value due to the variable nature of its

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has available a revolving loan facility with National City Bank (&#147;NCB&#148;) equal to the
lesser of (a) $3,000,000, (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and 90%
of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable or (c)&nbsp;four times the sum of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve month period. Outstanding
borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% payable monthly which
amounted to 2.75% as of March&nbsp;31, 2010. The Company also must pay an unused revolving loan
commitment fee of 0.25% of the average daily amount by which the revolving loan commitment exceeds
the outstanding principal amount. The amount paid on the unused revolving loan commitment fee
amounted to $1,443 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010. The revolving loan expires on
December&nbsp;30, 2010. All borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company.
The outstanding balance on the revolving loan was $1,304,027 at March&nbsp;31, 2010. Available for
borrowing under the revolving loan on March&nbsp;31, 2010 was $441,862. The carrying amount of
receivables that served as collateral for borrowings totaled $1,745,889 at March&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has an acquisition loan of $500,000 with NCB (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;). The Acquisition
Loan was repaid and expired on December&nbsp;21, 2009. All borrowings under the Acquisition Loan were
collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. Borrowings under the Acquisition Loan
bore interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% payable monthly. The outstanding balances on the Acquisition
Loan were $0 and $500,000 at March&nbsp;31, 2010 and March&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The revolving loan facility is and the Acquisition Loan (the &#147;Loan Agreements&#148;) was secured by a
guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands
company (&#147;Fairford&#148;). As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, Fairford beneficially owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s
outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common
stock and director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole beneficiary of
a revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of the Company,
is the director of Fairford.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreements contain certain financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness,
encumbrances, investments, business combinations, and other related items. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010,
the Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants. The more significant covenants under
the Loan Agreements, include that, without NCB&#146;s prior written consent, the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to: (i)&nbsp;incur or have outstanding any indebtedness in
excess of $20,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate; (ii)&nbsp;dispose of all, or any part, of
business or assets; (iii)&nbsp;make any acquisitions, or (iv)&nbsp;issue any additional shares of stock or

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-5 to address concerns
regarding the determination of the fair value of liabilities. Because liabilities are often
not &#147;traded&#148;, due to restrictions placed on their transferability, there is typically a
very limited amount of trades (if any) from which to draw market
participant data. As such, many entities have had to determine the fair value of a liability
through the use of a hypothetical transaction. The ASU clarifies the valuation techniques that
must be used when the liability subject to the fair value determination is not traded as an asset
in an active market. The ASU was applicable for interim or annual periods beginning after October
1, 2009. The adoption has no impact on the Company.

<!-- xbrl -->
<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12 to address diversity in practice with respect to
how entities calculate net asset value per share or (&#147;NAV&#148;) of investments considered
&#147;alternative investments&#148;, such as hedge funds, private equity funds, or funds of funds. Many
times, these types of investments do not have readily determinable fair values. Historically,
some believed that the NAV of a particular investment equaled its fair value without the need to
consider such attributes as the inability to transfer the investment to a party other than the
fund, calls for additional investment, etc. This ASU amends ASC 820 and provides a practical
expedient for measuring the fair value of investments in a limited number of entities that
calculate NAV. The ASU also provides enhanced disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for
interim and annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2009. The adoption has no impact on the
Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13 &#151; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements -
a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force applies to multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements that are currently within the scope of Topic 605-25. This ASU also provides principles
and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be
separated, and the consideration allocated, requires an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have
vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates the use of
the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
method. The consensus significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with
earlier application permitted. Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU on a
retrospective basis. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on
the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-14 &#151; Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
Elements &#151; a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force was issued concurrently with ASU
No.&nbsp;2009-13 and focuses on determining which arrangements are within the scope of the software
revenue guidance in Topic 985 and which are subject to the guidance in ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. This
ASU removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance and provides
guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible
product are within the scope of the software revenue model or the guidance in revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables model, ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. Generally, if the software
contained in or part of the arrangement with the tangible product is essential to the tangible
product&#146;s functionality, then the software is excluded from the software revenue guidance. The ASU
also provides factors to consider in evaluating whether the software was essential to the tangible
product or not. The disclosure requirements, effective date, and transition methods for this ASU
are the same as those for ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. An entity must adopt both ASUs in the same period using
the same transition method. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase, and restricted stock grants
of, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Individuals eligible for participation in the
Plan include designated officers and other employees (including employees who also serve as
directors), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants who perform services
for the Company. The terms of each grant under the Plan are determined by the Board of Directors,
or a committee of the board administering the Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a change of control of the Company as
in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Stock options granted under the Plan typically become
exercisable over a one to five year period. Generally, the options have various vesting periods,
which include immediate and term vesting periods.

grants will be granted under the Plan. Grants that were made under the Plan prior to stockholders&#146;
approval of the Stock Incentive Plan will continue to be administered under the Plan.

non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees of, and consultants and advisors to,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and to determine the number and types of such awards and the
terms, conditions, vesting and other limitations applicable to each such award. In addition, the
Compensation Committee has the power to interpret the Stock Incentive Plan and to adopt such rules

Incentive Plan.

purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock of the Company in consideration for securing the issuance
of a $2.6&nbsp;million letter of credit (the &#147;Letter of Credit&#148;) from SEB bank to National City Bank.
Due to National City Bank&#146;s receipt of the Letter of Credit, the Company was able to obtain the
Acquisition Loan at a favorable cash-backed interest rate. Effective April&nbsp;14, 2008, the Company
entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with Fairford Scandinavia and issued an additional

obligations and no material claims with respect thereto were outstanding. The Company does not

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagment (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice Over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute such software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications expenses while driving
internal efficiencies into their invoice receipt, validation, approval and payment workflow
processes. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor
communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or
client bill back. These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade
products. Customers typically purchase the VoIP products when upgrading or acquiring a new
enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection,
enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates its revenues and cash from several sources: software sales, license fees,
processing fees, implementation fees, training and consulting services, and enforcement revenues.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s software products and services are subject to changing technology and evolving
customer needs which require the Company to continually invest in research and development in order
to respond to such demands. The limited financial resources available to the Company require the
Company to concentrate on those business segments and product lines which provide the greatest
returns on investment. The EIM segment, as compared to the other business segments, provides the
predominant share of income from operations and cash flow from operations. The majority of
Telemanagement segment revenues are derived from its United Kingdom operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company reported revenue in the EIM segment of $2.7&nbsp;million and $2.9&nbsp;million for the three
months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For the Telemanagement segment, the Company
recorded revenues of $1.1&nbsp;million and $1.0&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The Patent Enforcement segment recorded revenue of $41 thousand and $0 for the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In the VoIP segment, revenue of $120
thousand and $72 thousand was recorded in the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that as voice and data services continue to commoditize, service providers
will seek alternative business models to replace revenue lost as a result of pricing pressures.
One such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted voice and video services.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first being that organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second being that the
capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and average revenue per user advantage possible by delivering such
managed and hosted service offerings, providers not only look at acquiring new customers but
converting legacy customers onto the NGN platform. The Company believes that this conversion
process is significant. Many legacy features and functions are not available on NGN platforms,
primarily due to the immaturity of the service delivery model.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications will help eliminate customer resistance to conversion to next
generation platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the
delivery of compelling value added services. In 2007, the Company marketed two applications,
emPulse, web-based communications traffic analysis

communications on behalf of their hosted and managed service customers. These applications will
also enable managed and hosted service customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and
data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform administration and back office functions
such as cost allocation or client bill back. These applications were released as enterprise-grade
products. The Company anticipates that customers will purchase these products when upgrading or
acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The Company has taken the business benefits of
these enterprise-grade applications and has delivered provider-grade managed and hosted service
applications, enabling service providers to create a new recurring revenue stream, while ensuring
that enterprise customers have the tools necessary and relevant to their particular line of
business or vertical. The Company&#146;s future success in the VoIP segment is directly related to the
successful market penetration of emPulse and SmartRecord&#174; IP.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial Condition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, the stockholders&#146; equity decreased $71,005 from
$8,536,147 as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 to $8,465,142 as of March&nbsp;31, 2010 primarily as a result of the
first quarter 2010 net loss of $223,131. The Company realized an increase in net current
assets (current assets less current liabilities) of approximately $173,607 which was primarily
attributable to the increase in receivables as of March&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At March&nbsp;31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents were $269,700 compared to $508,836 at December&nbsp;31,
2009, and such decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in operating and investing
activities offset by cash provided by financing activities. Cash used in the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2010 by operating activities amounted to $199,469 which was primarily related to the net
operating loss of $223,131. Cash provided by financing activities related to net borrowings of

$3,940,057 as compared to $3,949,288 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009. Revenues derived
from the UK operations represent 73.7% and 72.6% of total revenues for the three months ended March
31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The US revenues decreased by $45,949, or 4.2%, to $1,037,541 for
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to $1,083,490 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31,
2009. The decrease in US revenues was primarily related to a decrease in the revenue recognized
from the largest EIM customer in the United States due to decreased processing for that customer.
The Company earns a substantial portion of its revenue from a single EIM customer. This customer
represented 15.9% of the total revenues for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 19.4% for the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009. The Company believes that the portion of revenue from the
single largest EIM customer will decline due to the erosion of the customer&#146;s customer base while
the revenue from its second largest customer will remain consistent with prior periods.

based upon the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related
to revenue recognition, bad debts, depreciation and amortization, investments, income taxes,
capitalized software, goodwill, restructuring costs, accrued compensation, contingencies and
litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.

Statements and Supplementary Date &#150; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#150; Note 1&#148; in the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Income Taxes. </I>The Company is required to estimate its income taxes. This process involves
estimating the Company&#146;s actual current tax obligations together with assessing differences
resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, a
deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to
be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are assessed for each reporting period as to whether it is more
likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income, including assumptions
regarding on-going tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is
uncertain, the Company has established a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be
recovered. Changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax
provision in the statement of operations. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance
related only to net deferred tax assets in the United States. As a result, the Company&#146;s tax
expense relates to the UK operations and the Company does not anticipate recording significant tax
charges or benefits related to operating gains or losses for the Company&#146;s US operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the
tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to
occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely
of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than not&#148; test,
no tax benefit is recorded.

outside firm as was used in past years to assist in this analysis. The Company is satisfied as to
the qualifications and independence of this firm with respect to their ability to assist in this

beneficially owned by a majority stockholder, an overall &#147;flight to quality&#148; by investors in which

impaired. The Company will continue in the future to be aware of the market cap in our assessment
of its goodwill and may more frequently update its analysis of goodwill impairment in light of this
situation. The Company believes the year-end analysis is sufficiently current and no formal
analysis has been performed at March&nbsp;31, 2010. If the Company assesses market condition changes in
our business, it may be required to reflect goodwill impairment in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Long-Lived Assets. </I>The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived
assets on an annual basis. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates there is impairment, the amount of the
impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows.

is generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new
applications to existing customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements. Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training,
consulting, and customization are recognized as provided to customers. If the services are
essential to the functionality of the software, revenue from the software component is deferred
until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth in the guidance
related software revenue recognition. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the
entire arrangement is accounted for in with conformity guidance related to contract accounting.
The Company carefully evaluates the circumstances surrounding the implementations to determine
whether the percentage-of-completion method or the completed-contract method should be used. Most
implementations relate to the Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in less than 30
days once the work begins. The Company uses the completed-contract method on contracts that will
be completed within 30&nbsp;days since it produces a result similar to the percentage-of-completion
method. On contracts that will take over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company uses the
percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company continuously monitors collections
and payments from its customers and the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that the Company has identified. If the
financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Where an allowance for doubtful
accounts has been established with respect to customer receivables, as payments are made on such
receivables or if the customer goes out of business with no chance of collection, the allowances
will decrease with a corresponding adjustment to accounts receivable as deemed appropriate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-5 to address concerns
regarding the determination of the fair value of liabilities. Because liabilities are often
not &#147;traded&#148;, due to restrictions placed on their transferability, there is typically a very limited amount of trades (if any) from
which to draw market participant data. As such, many entities have had to determine the fair value
of a liability through the use of a hypothetical transaction. The ASU clarifies the valuation
techniques that must be used when the liability subject to the fair value determination is not
traded as an asset in an active market. The ASU was applicable for interim or annual periods
beginning after October&nbsp;1, 2009. The adoption has no impact on the Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12 to address diversity in practice with respect to
how entities calculate net asset value per share or (&#147;NAV&#148;) of investments considered
&#147;alternative investments&#148;, such as hedge funds, private equity funds, or funds of funds. Many
times, these types of investments do not have readily determinable fair values. Historically,
some believed that the NAV of a particular investment equaled its fair value without the need to
consider such attributes as the inability to transfer the investment to a party other than the
fund, calls for additional investment, etc. This ASU amends ASC 820 and provides a practical
expedient for measuring the fair value of investments in a limited number of entities that
calculate NAV. The ASU also provides enhanced disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for
interim and annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2009. The adoption has no impact on the
Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13 &#151; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements -
a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force applies to multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements that are currently within the scope of Topic 605-25. This ASU also provides principles
and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be
separated, and the consideration allocated, requires an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have
vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates the use of
the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
method. The consensus significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with
earlier application permitted. Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU on a
retrospective basis. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on
the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-14 &#151; Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
Elements &#151; a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force was issued concurrently with ASU
No.&nbsp;2009-13 and focuses on determining which arrangements are within the scope of the software
revenue guidance in Topic 985 and which are subject to the guidance in ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. This
ASU removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance and provides
guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible
product are within the scope of the software revenue model or the guidance in revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables model, ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. Generally, if the software
contained in or part of the arrangement with the tangible product is essential to the tangible
product&#146;s functionality, then the software is excluded from the software revenue guidance. The ASU
also provides factors to consider in evaluating whether the software was essential to the tangible
product or not. The disclosure requirements, effective date, and transition methods for this ASU
are the same as those for ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. An entity must adopt both ASUs in the same period using
the same transition method. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
reaching a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company&#146;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (&#147;Internal Control&#148;) to determine whether
any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have
materially affected or which are reasonably likely to materially affect Internal Control. Based on
that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary its
procedures and controls.

the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington by Qwest Corporation
seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the Company&#146;s Patent
No.&nbsp;5,287,270. An amended complaint was filed on July&nbsp;13, 2004 adding Qwest Communications
Corporation to that action. The Company filed a motion with the United States District Court for
the Western District of Washington seeking to dismiss that action or, in the alternative, to
transfer it to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;12, 2004, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington
granted the Company&#146;s motion to the extent of transferring the action to the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The Company asserted counterclaims alleging patent
infringement and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana then
consolidated the transferred action with the pending patent infringement lawsuit disclosed above
under &#147;BellSouth Corporation et al.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On January&nbsp;9, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana issued
its claim construction for U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. On January&nbsp;18, 2008, the Qwest entities filed
a motion for stay and a summary judgment motion of invalidity based on the construction of one of
the claim terms. The motions were fully briefed on an expedited basis and on February&nbsp;26, 2008, the
court denied the motions. Fact discovery closed on December&nbsp;23, 2008. Expert discovery was
completed on April&nbsp;1, 2009. On April&nbsp;15, 2009, the parties filed various summary judgment motions
related to patent infringement and invalidity and immunity from suit concerning the Networx
government contracts. On September&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court granted the Qwest entities&#146; motion for
summary judgment of immunity from suit concerning the Networx government contracts, thereby
requiring the Company to sue the Government in the Court of Federal Claims. On October&nbsp;29, 2009,
the Court ruled on the parties&#146; patent invalidity and noninfringement summary judgment motions. The
Court held that the Company&#146;s U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270 was valid but not infringed by the Qwest
entities. In November&nbsp;2009, the Company filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). The Qwest entities subsequently cross appealed.
Briefing before the Federal Circuit commenced February&nbsp;19, 2010 and is expected to be completed in
June&nbsp;2010. Oral argument before the Federal Circuit is expected to occur in the Fall of 2010.
