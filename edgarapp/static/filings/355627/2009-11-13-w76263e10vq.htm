(Holdings) Inc. and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) include this cautionary statement regarding
forward-looking statements for the express purpose of using protections of the safe-harbor provided
by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to all such forward-looking
statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (a)
projections of revenues, capital expenditures, growth, prospects, dividends, capital structure and
other financial matters; (b)&nbsp;statements of plans and objectives of the Company or its management or
board of directors; (c)&nbsp;statements of future economic performance; (d)&nbsp;statements of assumptions
underlying other statements and statements about the Company and its business relating to the
future; and (e)&nbsp;any statements using the words &#147;anticipate&#148;, &#147;expect&#148;, &#147;may&#148;, &#147;project&#148;, &#147;intend&#148;,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s ability to predict projected results or the effect of certain events on the Company&#146;s
operating results is inherently uncertain. Therefore, the Company wishes to caution each reader of
this Quarterly Report to carefully consider the risk factors stated in the Company&#146;s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, any or all of which have in the past and
could in the future affect the ability of the Company to achieve its anticipated results and could
cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein, including, but not limited
to: effects of current economic crisis, ability to attract and retain customers to purchase its
products, ability to develop or launch new software products, technological advances by third
parties and competition, ability to protect the Company&#146;s patented technology, and ability to
obtain settlements in connection with its patent enforcement activities. You should not place
any undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any intent or
obligations to update forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q.

support billing and data management software and services and carrier class voice over internet
protocol management applications.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company was originally incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1968 and reincorporated in the State of
Delaware in 1988, pursuant to a merger of CTI into a wholly owned subsidiary formed as a Delaware
corporation. In November&nbsp;1995, the Company changed its name to CTI Group (Holdings) Inc.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of the following business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagement (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides electronic invoice
presentment, analysis and payment software that enables internet-based customer self-care for
wireline, wireless and convergent providers of telecommunications services. EIM software and
services are used primarily by telecommunications services providers to enhance their customer
relationships while reducing the providers operational expenses related to paper-based invoice
delivery and customer support relating to billing inquiries. Telemanagement software and services
allows end users to manage their usage of multi-media communications services and equipment. VoIP
designs, develops and provides software and services that enable customers of service providers to
analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform administration
and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back. These applications are
commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade products. Customers typically purchase these
products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement
involves the licensing, protection, enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property
and rights.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit,
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), and
reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain information in footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, has been
condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, although the Company
believes the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 and the notes thereto included in the Company&#146;s Form
10-K filed with the SEC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;).
The FASB establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;) that
the Company follows. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(&#147;SEC&#148;) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
registrants, which the Company is required to follow. References to GAAP issued by the FASB in
these footnotes are to the FASB <I>Accounting Standards Codification </I>(&#147;ASC&#148;), which serves as a single
source of authoritative non-SEC accounting and reporting standards to be applied by nongovernmental
entities. The FASB finalized the ASC effective for periods ending on or after September&nbsp;15, 2009.
Prior FASB standards like FASB Statement of Accounting Standards and FASB Staff Positions, are no
longer being issued by the FASB. For further discussion of the ASC, see &#147;New Accounting
Pronouncements&#148; in Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations elsewhere in this report.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized once
the Company has received a signed agreement, settlement or judgment and the collection of the
receivable is deemed probable. The Company recognized $0 and $2,850,000 in revenues associated
with patent license fee and enforcement activities in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and
2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company records revenue when it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from software
licenses are recognized upon shipment, delivery or customer acceptance, based on the substance of
the arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining
vendor obligations to be fulfilled and collectability is reasonably assured. Software sales
revenue is generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users
and new applications to existing customers.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has available a revolving loan facility with National City Bank (&#147;NCB&#148;) equal to the
lesser of (a) $3,000,000, (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and 90%
of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable or (c)&nbsp;four times the sum of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve month period. Outstanding
borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% payable monthly which
amounted to 2.75% as of September&nbsp;30, 2009. The Company also must pay an unused revolving loan
commitment fee of 0.25% of the average daily amount by which the revolving loan commitment exceeds
the outstanding principal amount. The amount of expense on the unused revolving loan commitment
fee amounted to approximately $4,500 and $1,500 for the nine and three months ended September&nbsp;30,
2009, respectively. The revolving loan expires on December&nbsp;30, 2010. All borrowings are
collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. The outstanding balance on the revolving
loan was $361,000 at September&nbsp;30, 2009. The amount available for borrowing under the revolving
loan on September&nbsp;30, 2009 was $930,043. The carrying amount of receivables that served as
collateral for borrowings totaled $1,291,043 at September&nbsp;30, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company entered into a second modification of the loan documents with NCB
(the &#147;Second Modification&#148;). The Second Modification reduced the acquisition loan from $2,600,000
to $500,000 (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;). The Acquisition Loan expires on December&nbsp;21, 2009, unless
extended. All borrowings under the Acquisition Loan are collateralized by substantially all assets
of the Company. The Acquisition Loan was secured by a letter of credit from SEB Bank to NCB.
Under the Second Modification, NCB removed the provision in the Loan Agreement requiring that the
Company obtain a letter of credit as security for the Acquisition Loan. Pursuant to the terms of
the Second Modification, NCB executed a notice of termination and release of the Letter of Credit
dated November&nbsp;18, 2008. Borrowings under the Acquisition Loan bear interest (2.25% at September
30, 2009) at LIBOR plus 2.00% payable monthly. The outstanding balances on the Acquisition Loan
were $500,000 and $2,600,000 at September&nbsp;30, 2009 and September&nbsp;30, 2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The revolving loan facility and Acquisition Loan (the &#147;Loan Agreements&#148;) were secured by a
guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands
company. As of September&nbsp;30, 2009, Fairford beneficially owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s outstanding
Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and
director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole beneficiary of a
revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of the Company, is
the director of Fairford<B>.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Borrowings under the Loan Agreements are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on
indebtedness, encumbrances, investments, business combinations, and other related items. As of
September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. The more significant
covenants under the Loan Agreements, include that, without NCB&#146;s prior written consent, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to: (i)&nbsp;incur or have outstanding any
indebtedness in excess of $20,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate; (ii)&nbsp;dispose of all,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>NOTE 5: New Accounting Pronouncements</B>
</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued guidance on fair value
measurements. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance establishes a fair value
hierarchy about the assumptions used to measure fair value and clarifies assumptions about risk and
the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset. The guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued additional guidance
which delayed the effective date for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except
those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) to
fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
adoption of the new guidance had no material effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements. In
October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued additional guidance which clarifies the application of the original
guidance in an inactive market and explains that when relevant and observable market information is
not available to determine the measurement of an asset&#146;s fair value, management must use their
judgment about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset in a current
sale transaction. Appropriate risk adjustments that a market participant would use must also be
taken into account when determining the fair value. Application of this guidance should be
accounted for as a change in estimate and was effective upon issuance. Upon adoption of this
guidance, there was no material impact on the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of
activity for the asset and liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that
are not orderly. This guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in
the volume and level of activity, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same. Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market
participants. The guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there
has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in
relation to normal market activity. In addition, when transactions or quoted prices are not
considered orderly, adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be
needed to determine the appropriate fair value. The guidance also requires increased disclosures.
This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009, and
shall be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15,
2009. The Company adopted this new guidance in the second quarter, however, the adoption did not
have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on interim disclosures about fair value of financial
instruments. This guidance amends FASB&#146;s previous guidance on disclosures about fair value of
financial instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim
reporting periods of publicly traded companies that were previously only required in annual
financial statements. This amended guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending
after June&nbsp;15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The
Company adopted this amended guidance in the second quarter. See Note 3 of these Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events. This guidance establishes accounting
and reporting standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. The guidance became effective for fiscal
years and interim periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company adopted the new guidance during
the second quarter of 2009. See Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for more information.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on the FASB accounting standards codification and hierarchy
of generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance establishes the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification as the authoritative source of accounting principals to be used in the
preparation of the financial statements by nongovernmental entities. The guidance is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods ending after September&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company adopted this new
guidance during the third quarter of 2009. There was no material effect of the adoption of this
guidance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-5 to address concerns
regarding the determination of the fair value of liabilities. Because liabilities are often
not &#147;traded&#148;, due to restrictions

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">placed on their transferability, there is typically a very limited amount of trades (if any) from
which to draw market participant data. As such, many entities have had to determine the fair value
of a liability through the use of a hypothetical transaction. The ASU clarifies the valuation
techniques that must be used when the liability subject to the fair value determination is not
traded as an asset in an active market. The ASU would be applicable for interim or annual periods
beginning after October&nbsp;1, 2009. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of
this ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12 to address diversity in practice with respect to
how entities calculate net asset value per share or (&#147;NAV&#148;) of investments considered
&#147;alternative investments&#148;, such as hedge funds, private equity funds, or funds of funds. Many
times, these types of investments do not have readily determinable fair values. Historically,
some believed that the NAV of a particular investment equaled its fair value without the need to
consider such attributes as the inability to transfer the investment to a party other than the
fund, calls for additional investment, etc. This ASU amends ASC 820 and provides a practical
expedient for measuring the fair value of investments in a limited number of entities that
calculate NAV. The ASU also provides enhanced disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for
interim and annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company has not yet determined the
effect of the adoption of this ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13 &#151; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements -
a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force applies to multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements that are currently within the scope of Topic 605-25. This ASU also provides principles
and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be
separated, and the consideration allocated, requires an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have
vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates the use of
the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
method. The consensus significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with
earlier application permitted. Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU on a
retrospective basis. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on
the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-14 &#151; Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
Elements &#151; a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force was issued concurrently with ASU
No.&nbsp;2009-13 and focuses on determining which arrangements are within the scope of the software
revenue guidance in Topic 985 and which are subject to the guidance in ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. This
ASU removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance and provides
guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible
product are within the scope of the software revenue model or the guidance in revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables model, ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. Generally, if the software
contained in or part of the arrangement with the tangible product is essential to the tangible
product&#146;s functionality, then the software is excluded from the software revenue guidance. The ASU
also provides factors to consider in evaluating whether the software was essential to the tangible
product or not. The disclosure requirements, effective date, and transition methods for this ASU
are the same as those for ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. An entity must adopt both ASUs in the same period using
the same transition method. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, there were no additional common shares to be
issued assuming exercise of stock options and stock warrants, since all options and warrants had an
exercise price higher than the average stock price. For the nine months and three months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2009, outstanding stock options were excluded from weighted average shares of common
and common equivalent shares outstanding due to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of the
Company&#146;s net loss. Additional common shares to be issued, assuming exercise of stock options for

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) provides for
the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase, and restricted stock grants
of, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Individuals eligible for participation in the
Plan include designated officers and other employees (including employees who also serve as
directors), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants who perform services
for the Company. The terms of each grant under the Plan are determined by the Board of Directors,
or a committee of the board administering the Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a change of control of the Company as
in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Stock options granted under the Plan typically become
exercisable over a one to five year period. Generally, the options have various vesting periods,
which include immediate and term vesting periods.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;8, 2005, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved the CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan (the &#147;Stock Incentive Plan&#148;). The Stock Incentive Plan replaced the Plan. No new
grants will be granted under the Plan. Grants that were made under the Plan prior to stockholders&#146;
approval of the Stock Incentive Plan will continue to be administered under the Plan. On May&nbsp;28,
2008, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock authorized for issuance pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan from 3,000,000 shares to
6,000,000 shares.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee is authorized to grant awards to
non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees of, and consultants and advisors to,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and to determine the number and types of such awards and the
terms, conditions, vesting and other limitations applicable to each such award. In addition, the
Compensation Committee has the power to interpret the Stock Incentive Plan and to adopt such rules
and regulations as it considers necessary or appropriate for purposes of administering the Stock
Incentive Plan.

specified events. Such shares may be treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares. As of
September&nbsp;30, 2009, there were 1,903,468 awards available for grant under the Stock Incentive Plan.
If any outstanding award is cancelled, forfeited, or surrendered to the Company, shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock allocable to such award may again be available for awards under the Stock Incentive
Plan. Incentive stock options may be granted only to participants who are executive officers and
other employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the day of the grant, and
non-qualified stock options may be granted to any participant in the Stock Incentive Plan. No
stock option granted under the Stock Incentive Plan will be exercisable later than ten years after
the date it is granted.

valuation model (Black-Scholes-Merton formula) that uses the assumptions noted in the foregoing
table. Because closed-form valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those
ranges are disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from historical
volatility of the Company&#146;s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and
employee termination within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar
historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of
options granted is derived from general practices used by other companies in the software industry
and estimates by the Company of the period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The volatility, dividend yield,

wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement (the
&#147;Agreement&#148;), dated February&nbsp;16, 2007. Pursuant to the Agreement, on February&nbsp;16, 2007, the Company
issued to Fairford Scandinavia a Class&nbsp;A common stock Purchase Warrant (the &#147;Original Warrant&#148;) to
purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock of the Company in consideration for securing the issuance
of a $2.6&nbsp;million letter of credit (the &#147;Letter of Credit&#148;) from SEB bank to National City Bank.
Due to National City Bank&#146;s receipt of the Letter of Credit, the Company was able to obtain the
Acquisition Loan at a favorable cash-backed interest rate. Effective April&nbsp;14, 2008, the Company
entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with Fairford Scandinavia and issued an additional
warrant to Fairford Scandinavia to purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock based on the interest
rate savings (the &#147;Additional Warrant&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pursuant to the Original Warrant, Fairford Scandinavia is entitled to purchase 419,495 shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock at the exercise price of $0.34 per share, subject to adjustments as described
in the Original Warrant, at any time prior to the 10th anniversary of the date of issuance.
Pursuant to the Additional Warrant, Fairford Scandinavia is entitled to purchase 620,675 shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock at the exercise price of $0.22 per share, subject to adjustments as described
in the Additional Warrant, at any time prior to the 10th anniversary of the date of issuance. As
of September&nbsp;30, 2009, Fairford beneficially owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A
common stock and Fairford Scandinavia owned warrants to purchase 1,040,170 shares of the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and
a director of the Company, is a director of Fairford, the President of Fairford Scandinavia and a
grantor and sole beneficiary of a revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.
Dahl, a director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and the Chairman of Fairford
Scandinavia. The Original Warrant and Additional Warrant vested immediately upon grant. The
expense related to the warrants granted to Fairford Scandinavia was charged to deferred financing
fees and amortized to interest expense for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and 2008 of $0

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s agreements with customers generally require the Company to indemnify the customer
against claims that the Company&#146;s software infringes third party patent, copyright, trademark or
other proprietary rights. Such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of
industry-standard provisions including our right to replace the infringing product. As of
September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Company did not experience any material losses related to these
indemnification obligations and no material claims with respect thereto were outstanding. The
Company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and
consequently, the Company has not established any related accruals.

unrecognized tax benefits, respectively, all of which would favorably affect the Company&#146;s
effective tax rate if recognized. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal
income tax as well as income tax of the state of Indiana and foreign income tax in the United
Kingdom. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before

Operations.</B>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Overview</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagement (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute the software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications expenses while reducing
the resource investment required to process, validate, approve, and pay their telecommunication
invoices. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, and data usage, record and monitor communications,
and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back.
These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade products. Customers
typically purchase these products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications
platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection, enforcement and defense of the
Company&#146;s intellectual property, including patents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates its revenues and cash from several sources: software sales, license fees,
processing fees, implementation fees, training and consulting services, and enforcement revenues.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s software products and services are subject to changing technology and evolving
customer needs which require the Company to continually invest in research and development in order
to respond to such demands. The limited financial resources available to the Company require the
Company to concentrate on those business segments and product lines which provide the greatest
returns on investment. The EIM segment, as compared to the other business segments, provides the
predominant share of income from operations and cash flow from operations. The majority of
Telemanagement segment revenues are derived from its United Kingdom operations. The VoIP segment
is a relatively new segment which the Company believes offers growth opportunity; however, there
can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in the VoIP market. The Company believes
it is able to develop and market its VoIP products with its current resources and will not need to
incur incremental costs to support this segment. The Company reported revenue in the EIM segment
of $7.9&nbsp;million and $10.6&nbsp;million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, and $2.2&nbsp;million and $3.3&nbsp;million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that as voice and data services continue to commoditize, service providers are
seeking alternative business models to replace revenue lost directly as a result of pricing
pressures. One such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted voice services.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice services would purchase enabling
communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate the
associated capital expense over time. The Company believes that this approach had two major
disadvantages for such organizations. The first being that organizations would experience
significant capital and operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The
second being that the capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice
service technology evolved.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice features while
reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and revenue per user advantage possible by delivering such managed and
hosted service offerings that do not require expensive equipment, providers not only look at
acquiring new customers but converting

significant. Many legacy features and functions are not available on NGN platforms, primarily due
to the immaturity of the service delivery model.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications help eliminate customer resistance to conversion to the next
generation platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the
delivery of compelling value added services. The Company is marketing its two VoIP applications,
emPulse, a web-based communications traffic analysis solution, and SmartRecord<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP, which enables
service providers to selectively intercept communications on behalf of their hosted and managed
service customers. These applications also enable managed and hosted service customers of service
providers to analyze voice and data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform
administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back. Although no
assurances can be made, the Company anticipates that customers will purchase these products when
upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The Company has taken the business
benefits of these enterprise-grade applications and has delivered provider-grade managed and hosted
service applications, enabling service providers to create a new recurring revenue stream, while
ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools necessary and relevant to their particular line
of business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Company experienced a change in its financial
condition as a result of a net loss of $1,528,238. The change was primarily attributable to a
decrease in revenue in the United Kingdom of $3,217,722 which was primarily attributable to the
weakening of the UK pound against the US dollar and a decrease in the revenue in the United States
of $3,413,874 primarily related to no patent revenue recognized in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At September&nbsp;30, 2009, cash and cash equivalents were $614,500 compared to $341,936 at December&nbsp;31,
2008, and such increase was primarily attributable to cash provided by operating activities of
$725,062 and cash borrowed under the Company&#146;s credit agreements of $361,000. The increase in cash
due to borrowing and operating activities was partially offset by cash used in investing activities
of $923,197. Cash generated in the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 by operating activities
amounted to $725,062 which was primarily related to non-cash depreciation of $1,146,724 and
increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable of $664,221 and $331,400, respectfully,
partially off-set by the net operating loss of $1,528,238. Cash utilized in investing activities
of $923,197 related to additions to property, equipment and software. The Company realized a
decrease in net current assets (current assets less current liabilities) of $716,164 which was
primarily attributable to the increase in accounts payable of $362,371 and an increase in deferred
revenue of $808,109. The Company realized a decline in stockholders&#146; equity of $1,448,812
primarily as a result of the net loss reported for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009. The
Company generates approximately 72% of its revenues from operations in the United Kingdom where the
functional currency, the UK pound, has increased since December&nbsp;31, 2008 by 10.2% in relation to
the US dollar as of September&nbsp;30, 2009.

36.3%, to $11,660,097 as compared to $18,291,693 for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. The
decrease in revenue was primarily due to the $3,217,722, or 27.7% decrease of revenue derived from
the UK operations associated with a 20.1% drop in the UK pound to US dollar average exchange rate
for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 compared to the average exchange rate for the nine
months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. Revenues derived from the UK operations represent 72.0% and 63.5%
of total revenues for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The US
revenues decreased by $3,413,874, or 51.1%, to $3,266,908 for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
2009 compared to $6,680,782 for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. The decrease in US
revenues was primarily due to a decrease of $2,850,000 in Patent Enforcement revenue and a decrease
in the revenue from the largest EIM customer in the United States due to decreased processing for
that customer. The Company earns a substantial portion of its revenue from a single EIM customer.
This customer represented 18.9% of the total revenues for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009
and 14.5% for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. The increase in the percentage in the
largest customer was primarily the result of a decrease in total revenue. The Company believes
that revenue from the single largest EIM customer will continue to decline due to the erosion of
the customer&#146;s revenue.

operations for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 of $2,474,397, $(74,409), $(2,037,060) and
$(826,836), respectively. The Corporate Allocation expense generated an operating loss of
$(826,825) for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009. The United States location generated a
loss from operations for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 of $(1,791,970) which was
primarily associated with losses generated in the VoIP segment, Patent Enforcement segment, and the
Corporate Allocations expense. The United Kingdom location generated income from operations for
the same period of $501,237. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 the EIM, Telemanagement,
VoIP, and Patent Enforcement segments represented income / (loss)&nbsp;from operations of $2,893,188,
$536,398, $(2,042,045) and $1,251,768, respectively. The Corporate Allocation expense generated an
operating loss of $(1,320,063) for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. The United States
location generated income from operations for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 of $282,782
which was primarily associated with income from the Patent Enforcement segment partially offset by
corporate expenses and a loss from the VoIP segment. The United Kingdom location generated income
from operations for the same period of $1,036,464.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has available a revolving loan facility with National City Bank (&#147;NCB&#148;) equal to the
lesser of (a) $3,000,000, (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic trade accounts receivable and 90%
of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable or (c)&nbsp;four times the sum of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the trailing twelve month period. Outstanding
borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% payable monthly which
amounted to 2.75% as of September&nbsp;30, 2009. The Company also must pay an unused revolving loan
commitment fee of 0.25% of the average daily amount by which the revolving loan commitment exceeds
the outstanding principal amount. The amount of expense on the unused revolving loan commitment
fee amounted to approximately $4,500 and $1,500 for the nine and three months ended September&nbsp;30,
2009, respectively. The revolving loan expires on December&nbsp;30, 2010. All borrowings are
collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. The outstanding balance on the revolving
loan was $361,000 at September&nbsp;30, 2009. The amount available for borrowing under the revolving
loan on September&nbsp;30, 2009 was $930,043. The carrying amount of receivables that served as
collateral for borrowings totaled $1,291,043 at September&nbsp;30, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On November&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company entered into a second modification of the loan documents with NCB
(the &#147;Second Modification&#148;). The Second Modification reduced the acquisition loan from $2,600,000
to $500,000 (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;). The Acquisition Loan expires on December&nbsp;21, 2009, unless
extended. All borrowings under the Acquisition Loan are collateralized by substantially all assets
of the Company. The Acquisition Loan was secured by a letter of credit from SEB Bank to NCB.
Under the Second Modification, NCB removed the provision in the Loan Agreement requiring that the
Company obtain a letter of credit as security for the Acquisition Loan. Pursuant to the terms of
the Second Modification, NCB executed a notice of termination and release of the Letter of Credit
dated November&nbsp;18, 2008. Borrowings under the Acquisition Loan bear interest (2.25% at September
30, 2009) at LIBOR plus 2.00% payable monthly. The outstanding balances on the Acquisition Loan
were $500,000 and $2,600,000 at September&nbsp;30, 2009 and September&nbsp;30, 2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The revolving loan facility and Acquisition Loan (the &#147;Loan Agreements&#148;) were secured by a
guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands
company. As of September&nbsp;30, 2009, Fairford beneficially owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s outstanding
Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and
director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole beneficiary of a
revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of the Company, is
the director of Fairford<B>.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Borrowings under the Loan Agreements are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on
indebtedness, encumbrances, investments, business combinations, and other related items. As of
September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. The more significant
covenants under the Loan Agreements, include that, without NCB&#146;s prior written consent, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to: (i)&nbsp;incur or have outstanding any
indebtedness in excess of $20,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate; (ii)&nbsp;dispose of all,
or any part, of business or assets; (iii)&nbsp;make any acquisitions, or (iv)&nbsp;issue any additional
shares of stock or other securities and the Company shall not issue more than 10% of the Company&#146;s
capital stock pursuant to its stock option plan on a fully-diluted basis. Any borrowings by the
Company under the revolving loan greater than that available will create an event of default; the
Loan Agreements permit such event of default to be cured within a reasonable period of time by
Fairford with the extension of appropriate credit or funding to the Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a single EIM customer. This single
customer generated approximately $2.2&nbsp;million and $2.6&nbsp;million in the nine months ended September
30, 2009 and September&nbsp;30, 2008, respectively (18.9% of revenue for the nine months ended September
30, 2009 and 14.5% or revenue for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008). This customer&#146;s
contract includes an automatic annual renewal provision; however, the contract can be terminated at
any time by either party with four months advanced notice. In 2009 and 2008, the Company
experienced significant decreases in the processing for this customer and anticipates additional
decreased processing revenue. The loss of this customer would have a substantial negative impact
on the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s primary sources of liquidity over the next twelve months will be cash on hand,
anticipated cash generated from future operating activities and the cash available to the Company
under the revolving loan facility.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company expects to continue to require funds to meet debt service obligations, capital
expenditures and other non-operating expenses. The Company&#146;s future capital requirements will
depend on many factors, including revenue growth, expansion of service offerings and business
strategy. The Company believes that expected future earnings from operations, available funds,
together with existing revolving credit facility, will be adequate to satisfy its planned
operations for the next 12&nbsp;months.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The discussion and analysis of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations are
based upon the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related
to revenue recognition, bad debts, depreciation and amortization, investments, income taxes,
capitalized software, goodwill, restructuring costs, accrued compensation, contingencies and
litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. For the
description of other critical accounting policies used by the Company, see Item&nbsp;8. &#147;Financial
Statements and Supplementary Date &#151; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#151; Note 1&#148; in the
Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Income Taxes. </I>The Company is required to estimate its income taxes. This process involves
estimating the Company&#146;s actual current tax obligations together with assessing differences
resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, a
deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to
be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are assessed for each reporting period as to whether it is more
likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income, including assumptions
regarding on-going tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is
uncertain, the Company has established a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be
recovered. Changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax
provision in the statement of operations. As of September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Company&#146;s valuation
allowance related only to net deferred tax assets in the United States. As a result, the Company&#146;s
tax expense relates to the UK operations and the Company does not anticipate recording significant
tax charges or benefits related to operating gains or losses for the Company&#146;s US operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes a tax position as a benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the
tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to
occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely
of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than not&#148; test,
no tax benefit is recorded.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of
the state of Indiana and foreign income tax in the United Kingdom. The Company is no longer
subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2002. The Company does not expect
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase in the next twelve months.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax
expense. The Company did not have any amounts accrued for interest and penalties at September&nbsp;30,
2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s tax filings are subject periodically to regulatory review and audit.

charged to operations as incurred. Software Development Costs are considered for capitalization
when technological feasibility is established. The Company bases its determination of when
technological feasibility is established based on the development team&#146;s determination that the
Company has completed all planning, designing, coding and testing activities that are necessary to
establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including, functions,
features, and technical performance requirements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Goodwill and Intangible Assets. </I>The Company considers the goodwill and related intangible assets
related to CTI Billing Solutions Limited to be the premium the Company paid for CTI Billing
Solutions Limited. For accounting purposes, these assets are maintained at the corporate level and
the Company considers the functional currency with respect to these assets the U.S. dollar.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain
circumstances, and written down when impaired. There were no impairments in 2009 and 2008.
Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these
lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost, less
accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets, generally 3-15&nbsp;years. Intangible assets consist of patents, purchased
technology, trademarks and trade names, and customer lists.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has allocated goodwill and a significant component of its intangible assets to CTI
Billing Solutions Limited, as that entity is considered a separate reporting unit. The Company
performed its annual impairment analysis on goodwill as of the October&nbsp;1, 2008, to coincide with
the calendar date set in past years for this analysis. The Company&#146;s October&nbsp;1, 2009 annual
impairment analysis is currently in progress and impairments, if necessary, will be posted in the
fourth quarter of 2009. The Company&#146;s analysis considered the projected cash flows of the
reporting unit and gave consideration to appropriate factors in determining a discount rate to be
applied to these cash flows. The Company engaged the same outside firm as was used in past years
to assist in this analysis. The Company is satisfied as to the qualifications and independence of
this firm with respect to their ability to assist in this analysis. The results of this analysis
indicated that there was no Step One impairment as of the date of our annual impairment
determination.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Coincident with the decline in the overall stock market, the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock dropped
significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and has remained at low levels after year end. As of
November&nbsp;9, 2009, the Company&#146;s common stock closed at $0.12 per share and the &#147;market cap&#148; for the
Company&#146;s stock was approximately $3.5&nbsp;million which is well below the Company&#146;s reported book
value at September&nbsp;30, 2009 of approximately $8.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of the significant decline in the Company&#146;s stock price, the Company reviewed the
assumptions utilized in the impairment determination and again found that there existed no
impairment. The Company&#146;s operations of the business unit are primarily based on recurring revenues
and have not experienced an adverse change in anticipated performance considered in the impairment
analysis. The business units operating performance subsequent to the goodwill impairment analysis
has exceeded anticipated performance through the most recent period that information is available.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes that the market for our stock is significantly below our book value which
the Company attributes to a number of factors including very limited trading in the Company&#146;s Class
A common stock; a significant portion of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock (approximately 75%) is
beneficially owned by its majority stockholder, an overall &#147;flight to quality&#148; by investors in
which many &#147;penny stocks&#148; such as CTI&#146;s have been significantly downgraded in terms of pricing and
an overall lack of public awareness of its operations. While the Company cannot quantify the
impacts of these factors in terms of how they impact the difference between book value and our
stock&#146;s &#147;market cap&#148; The Company does not believe that the market in its Class&nbsp;A common stock is
sufficiently sophisticated to make a proper determination of the value of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
common stock such that it should drive the Company to reach a conclusion that impairment of its
goodwill has occurred when the Company believes that generally accepted valuation techniques using
its most recent assessments as to the future performance of our business indicate that is not
impaired. The Company will continue in the future to be aware of the market cap in our assessment
of its goodwill and may more frequently update its analysis of goodwill impairment in light of this
situation. The Company believes the year-end analysis is sufficiently current and no formal
analysis has been performed at September&nbsp;30, 2009. If the Company assesses market condition
changes in our business, it may be required to reflect goodwill impairment in the future.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Long-Lived Assets. </I>The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived
assets on an annual basis. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates there is impairment, the amount of the
impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Reserves. </I>The Company records revenue when
it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from software licenses are recognized upon
shipment, delivery or customer acceptance, based on the substance of the arrangement or as defined
in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor obligations to be
fulfilled and collectability is reasonably assured. Software sales revenue is generated from
licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new applications to
existing customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements. Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training,
consulting, and customization are recognized as provided to customers. If the services are
essential to the functionality of the software, revenue from the software component is deferred
until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth in the guidance
related software revenue recognition. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the
entire arrangement is accounted for in with conformity guidance related to contract accounting.
The Company carefully evaluates the circumstances surrounding the implementations to determine
whether the percentage-of-completion method or the completed-contract method should be used. Most
implementations relate to the Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in less than 30
days once the work begins. The Company uses the completed-contract method on contracts that will
be completed within 30&nbsp;days since it produces a result similar to the percentage-of-completion
method. On contracts that will take over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company uses the
percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company continuously monitors collections
and payments from its customers and the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that the Company has identified. If the
financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Where an allowance for doubtful
accounts has been established with respect to customer receivables, as payments are made on such
receivables or if the customer goes out of business with no chance of collection, the allowances
will decrease with a corresponding adjustment to accounts receivable as deemed appropriate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Legal Costs Related to Patent Enforcement Activities. </I>Hourly legal costs incurred while
pursuing patent license fee and enforcement revenues are expensed as incurred. Legal fees that are
contingent on the successful outcome of an enforcement claim are recorded when the patent license
fee and enforcement revenues are realized.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Stock Based Compensation. </I>The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in
exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the
fair value of those awards at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula
and the modified prospective method and, as such, results for prior periods have not been restated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes compensation cost net of a forfeiture rate and recognizes the compensation
cost for only those awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service

rate based on its historical experience and its expectations about future forfeitures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">
value measurements. This guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
about the assumptions used to measure fair value and clarifies assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an
asset. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February
2008, the FASB issued additional guidance which delayed the effective date for all nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on
a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, and
interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the new guidance had no material effect
on the Company&#146;s financial statements. In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued additional guidance which
clarifies the application of the original guidance in an inactive market and explains that when
relevant and observable market information is not available to determine the measurement of an
asset&#146;s fair value, management must use their judgment about the assumptions a market participant
would use in pricing the asset in a current sale transaction. Appropriate risk adjustments that a
market participant would use must also be taken into account when determining the fair value.
Application of this guidance should be accounted for as a change in estimate and was effective upon
issuance. Upon adoption of this guidance, there was no material impact on the Company&#146;s condensed
consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of
activity for the asset and liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that
are not orderly. This guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in
the volume and level of activity, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same. Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market
participants. The guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there
has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in
relation to normal market activity. In addition, when transactions or quoted prices are not
considered orderly, adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be
needed to determine the appropriate fair value. The guidance also requires increased disclosures.
This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009, and
shall be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15,
2009. The Company adopted this new guidance in the second quarter, however, the adoption did not
have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on interim disclosures about fair value of financial
instruments. This guidance amends FASB&#146;s previous guidance on disclosures about fair value of
financial instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim
reporting periods of publicly traded companies that were previously only required in annual
financial statements. This amended guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending
after June&nbsp;15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The
Company adopted this amended guidance in the second quarter. See Note 3 of the Notes to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events. This guidance establishes accounting
and reporting standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. The guidance became effective for fiscal
years and interim periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company adopted the new guidance during
the second quarter of 2009. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
more information.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on the FASB accounting standards codification and hierarchy
of generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance establishes the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification as the authoritative source of accounting principals to be used in the
preparation of the financial statements by nongovernmental entities. The guidance is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods ending after September&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company plans to adopted
this new guidance during the third quarter of 2009. There was no material effect of the adoption
of this guidance.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-5 to address concerns
regarding the determination of the fair value of liabilities. Because liabilities are often
not &#147;traded&#148;, due to restrictions placed on their transferability, there is typically a
very limited amount of trades (if any) from which to draw market participant data. As such, many
entities have had to determine the fair value of a liability through the use of a hypothetical
transaction. The ASU clarifies the valuation techniques that must be used when the liability
subject to the fair value determination is not traded as an asset in an active market. The ASU
would be applicable for interim or annual periods beginning after October&nbsp;1, 2009. The Company has
not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or
financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12 to address diversity in practice with respect to
how entities calculate net asset value per share or (&#147;NAV&#148;) of investments considered
&#147;alternative investments&#148;, such as hedge funds, private equity funds, or funds of funds. Many
times, these types of investments do not have readily

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">determinable fair values. Historically,
some believed that the NAV of a particular investment equaled its fair value without the need to
consider such attributes as the inability to transfer the investment to a party
other than the fund, calls for additional investment, etc. This ASU amends ASC 820 and provides a
practical expedient for measuring the fair value of investments in a limited number of entities
that calculate NAV. The ASU also provides enhanced disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective
for interim and annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company has not yet determined
the effect of the adoption of this ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial
position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13 &#151; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements -
a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force applies to multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements that are currently within the scope of Topic 605-25. This ASU also provides principles
and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be
separated, and the consideration allocated, requires an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have
vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates the use of
the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
method. The consensus significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with
earlier application permitted. Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU on a
retrospective basis. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on
the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-14 &#151; Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
Elements &#151; a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force was issued concurrently with ASU
No.&nbsp;2009-13 and focuses on determining which arrangements are within the scope of the software
revenue guidance in Topic 985 and which are subject to the guidance in ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. This
ASU removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance and provides
guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible
product are within the scope of the software revenue model or the guidance in revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables model, ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. Generally, if the software
contained in or part of the arrangement with the tangible product is essential to the tangible
product&#146;s functionality, then the software is excluded from the software revenue guidance. The ASU
also provides factors to consider in evaluating whether the software was essential to the tangible
product or not. The disclosure requirements, effective date, and transition methods for this ASU
are the same as those for ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. An entity must adopt both ASUs in the same period using
the same transition method. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching a reasonable level
of assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company&#146;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (&#147;Internal Control&#148;) to determine whether
any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have
materially affected or which are reasonably likely to materially affect Internal Control. Based on
that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary its
procedures and controls.

</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">The Company previously disclosed that on May&nbsp;11, 2004, an action was brought against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington by
Qwest Corporation seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the
Company&#146;s Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. An amended complaint was filed on July&nbsp;13, 2004 adding
Qwest Communications Corporation to that action. The Company filed a motion with the
United States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking to dismiss
that action or, in the alternative, to transfer it to the United States District Court for
the Southern District of Indiana. On November&nbsp;12, 2004, the United States District Court
for the Western District of Washington granted the Company&#146;s motion to the extent of
transferring the action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana. The Company asserted counterclaims alleging patent infringement and the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana then consolidated the
transferred action with the pending patent infringement lawsuit disclosed above under
&#147;BellSouth Corporation et al.&#148;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">On January&nbsp;9, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
issued its claim construction for U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. On January&nbsp;18, 2008, Qwest
entities filed a motion for stay and a summary judgment motion of invalidity based on the
construction of one of the claim terms. The motions were fully briefed on an expedited
basis and on February&nbsp;26, 2008, the court denied the motions. During April and May&nbsp;2008,
the parties filed amended pleadings to permit the Qwest entities to assert certain
affirmative defenses related to government contracts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 2%">Fact discovery closed on December&nbsp;23, 2008. Expert discovery was completed on April&nbsp;1,
2009. On April&nbsp;15, 2009, the parties filed various summary judgment motions related to
patent infringement and invalidity and immunity from suit concerning the Networx
government contracts. On September&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court granted the Qwest entities&#146; motion
for summary judgment of immunity from suit concerning the Networx government contracts.
On October&nbsp;29, 2009, the Court ruled on the parties&#146; patent invalidity and noninfringement
summary judgment motions. The Court held that the Company&#146;s U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270 was
valid but not infringed by the Qwest entities.
