Internet-based customer self-care for wireline, wireless and convergent providers of

operational expenses related to paper-based invoice delivery and customer support relating to
billing inquiries. Using the Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers
are able to electronically invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the
enterprise customers to improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications
expenses while reducing the resource investment required to process, validate, approve, and pay
their telecommunication invoices. The Company has historically marketed its EIM products and
services in North America and Europe directly to telecommunication service providers who then
market and distribute the product to their enterprise customers, which consist primarily of
businesses, government agencies and institutions. The Company actively markets EIM products and
services in both North America and Europe.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Competition and integration continue to reshape the communications industry. Continued downward
pressure on prices is driven by strong competition, the continued replacement of wireline services
with wireless alternatives, the introduction of new technologies based on internet protocol (&#147;IP&#148;)
including VoIP, video, and merger and acquisition activities of key service providers. As a
result of such pricing pressures, the Company has been required to reduce its pricing and achieve
product revenue growth through increased volume sales or processing of call detail records.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The industry dynamics noted above are expected to present opportunities for the Company&#146;s software
and service offerings. As service provider margins decline, the Company believes that it continues
to deliver a value message that demonstrates how its EIM and Telemanagement solutions create
competitive differentiation, stronger customer relationships, enhanced lifetime value and increased
operational efficiencies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following market drivers are consistent across the telecommunications industry segments
targeted by the Company. Each of these drivers is expected to positively impact the Company&#146;s
growth strategies and the Company&#146;s strategic business positioning. The following trends are
concurrent and are predicted to enhance the growing demand for the enhanced invoice delivery, and
processing capabilities provided by the Company&#146;s EIM products and services.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Convergence and Complexity. </I>The nature, size, needs and complexity of the telecommunications
industry continue to change. Consolidation and service expansion continue to narrow the playing
field in the Tier 1 service provider segment that includes Verizon Communications, Inc., Sprint
Corp/Nextel Communications, Inc. and AT&#038;T Inc. Opportunity exists within the Tier 1 segment but is
not the primary focus of the Company. Broad opportunities exist in the smaller Tier 2, 3 and 4
market segments that include the regional, niche, and smaller markets. Expanded/bundled service
offerings (local and long distance, voice and data, wireline and wireless, broadband DSL and
cable-based access) are valued by end customers but add significant complexity to the
customer/provider relationship. The industry has evolved around the Integrated Communications
Provider (&#147;ICP&#148;) model. Many service providers are achieving or have developed their ICP model via
acquisition and third-party resale. The Company&#146;s EIM and Telemanagement software and services
enable the ICPs to deliver a viable, integrated and converged experience to their customers &#151; even
if the providers&#146; internal systems and infrastructure may not yet support such integration.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Customer Relationship Management. </I>The Internet continues to redefine the relationship between
service providers and their customers. The industry has invested significant capital in an attempt
to streamline its interaction with customers and prospects alike. Service providers and industry
analysts view web-enabled customer self-care as the key to reducing costs by transitioning many
service and support functions directly to customers. A provider who successfully migrates customer
support functions onto the Web and into the hands of the customer consistently drives down costs,
drives up profits and increases customer satisfaction by enabling the customer to save time,
enhance convenience, and create the customer&#146;s own &#147;personalized&#148; user experience. Adoption and
use of the tools extended by service providers has been disappointing. By delivering a compelling
process and cost advantage to enterprise customers, the Company believes it can drive adoption and
improve the return on investment for service providers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Customer Ownership. </I>Managing the life cycle and maximizing the return from, and retention of,
customers are increasingly recognized to be more important than to simply focus on acquiring more
customers. In an industry experiencing increased acquisition costs, accelerating customer
turnover, and declining margins, it is vital to focus on retention and revenue per customer.
Service providers are seeking options enabling competitive differentiation in service delivery,
product bundling and customer self-care. The Company&#146;s electronic invoice presentment platform
strengthens the service provider&#146;s competitive position while optimizing key operational costs
involving customer care and paper billing fulfillment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Outsource/Service Bureau. </I>The providers in the telecommunications industry today are demonstrating
increasing interest in establishing third party relationships that add value to their product
portfolio while allowing the provider to focus on its core competencies. The
outsourcing/Application Service Provider (&#147;ASP&#148;) delivery model represents an alternative to the
risks and costs associated with rapidly changing technologies. Service providers are migrating
from in-house development to packaged vendor solutions. At no time in their history has
competition been so prevalent and the need to extend service portfolios so important. Companies
are seeking rapid systems acquisition and implementation from outside parties.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Single Vendor Relationships. </I>As competition continues to intensify across virtually every
communications segment, carriers and service providers are looking to their billing and customer
management infrastructure as one of the key differentiators. The industry is moving toward vendor
relationships that can offer integrated solutions. Critical to this requirement are speed of
implementation, scalability, modularity, and seamless integration with other critical business
support systems. As the global telecommunications market continues to evolve, end customers will
be drawn to service providers who not only offer a broad array of services but who will enable them
to see all telecommunication expenditures from a single point of contact (&#147;360&#186; Visibility&#148;).
Whether established incumbents or new market entrants, telecommunications providers require systems
that allow all services to be bundled together into value plans that encourage customer retention
and adoption of additional services. Furthermore, providers require customer management systems
that enable increasingly complex customer relationships to be managed through a unified,
user-friendly interface into the customer database.

Company had sales to a single customer aggregating $2,849,514 (18% of revenues) and $3,533,571 (16%
of revenues), respectively. Such customer represented 18% of software sales, service fee and
license fee revenues for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008. The contract with this
customer contains an automatic annual renewal provision renewable in March of each year; however,
such agreement also contains a 120-day advance notice termination provision. The decline in
revenue from this customer relates to the cancellation by the customer of several accounts that
were under the service minimums. The contract with this customer was renewed in March&nbsp;2010. The
loss of this customer would have a substantial negative impact on the Company&#146;s operations and
financial condition. There are three EIM customers that totaled $5,645,035 (55% of EIM revenues)

receipt of order and the 50% balance upon installation, which is normally completed within 10&nbsp;days.
Occasionally, larger software orders may require up to 3&nbsp;months to complete, custom software
development and installation. For software licensing via distributor channels, payment terms are
net 30&nbsp;days. Service bureau contracts provide monthly recurring revenue. Generally, contracts of
12 to 36&nbsp;months carry automatic 12-month renewals until canceled. CTI purchases data collection
devices specifically designed for use with telecommunications switches and other hardware such as
modems as are necessary to perform the telemanagement business. CTI rents or resells such

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As voice and data services continue to commoditize, the Company anticipates that service providers
will be seeking alternative business models to replace revenue lost directly as a result of pricing
pressures. The Company believes that one such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted
voice and video services. The Company&#146;s VoIP segment designs, develops and provides software and
services that enable managed and hosted customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and
data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform administration and back office functions
such as cost allocation or client bill back.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first being that organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second being that the
capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and ARPU advantage possible by delivering such managed and hosted service
offerings, providers not only look at acquiring new customers but converting legacy customers onto

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This conversion process, while potentially producing marked financial results for a service

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications are intended to eliminate customer resistance to conversion to NGN

providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor communications, and perform

applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade products. Customers can
purchase these products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The

provider-grade managed and hosted service applications intended to enable service providers to
create a new recurring revenue stream, while ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools
necessary and relevant to their particular line of business or vertical.

options to service providers for their hosted and managed service customers. Based upon patent

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers can distribute these products to their managed and hosted service customers by
either directly reselling the product or by integrating it into an existing service bundle,
increasing the value and price of the overall bundle offering. The Company believes that the
overall VoIP market will grow.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>emPulse </I>is a web-based communications traffic analysis solution that was released in March&nbsp;2007.
emPulse analyzes and reports on a variety of statistics related to communications, including but
not limited to, detailed traffic, communications quality of service, bandwidth utilization, call
center statistics, and organizational utilization information. emPulse integrates with the managed
or hosted communications switch and routing facilities to acquire this information, which is then
processed and analyzed. End-users log into the service provider&#146;s website where they are presented
with a reporting and analytics interface.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CTI owns two patents which cover a method and process to prepare, display, and analyze usage and
cost information for services including, but not limited to, telecommunications, financial card
services, and utilities (e.g., electricity, oil, gas, water). The patents expire in 2011. The
information can be provided to a user in an advantageous format that allows the user to quickly and
easily retrieve, display, and analyze the information. The systems covered by these patents enable
customer data to be sorted and processed in a manner so that the customer&#146;s generation of reports
is much faster than using a non-patented method. This patented technology is incorporated in the
Company&#146;s SmartBill<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> product. Other companies have developed programs to replicate this patented
process that the Company believes violate its patents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s patent enforcement activities involve the licensing, protection, enforcement and
defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights. The Company has instituted a marketing
approach for patent enforcement activities whereby the Company, in certain cases, actively pursues
a licensing arrangement with violators rather than litigation. The nature of patent enforcement
activities can require the Company to incur significant costs without realization of revenue until
subsequent future periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has historically undertaken numerous enforcement activities, in which it has been
successful in certain instances in enforcing its patents; however, no patent enforcement revenues
were recognized in 2009. As a matter of course, the defense of an outstanding lawsuit attacks the
validity of the patents. The Company does not anticipate that such attack will be successful but
the results of litigation are difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that the Company
will continue to be successful in enforcing its patents in the future or potentially

enforcement activities. Since patent enforcement activities require significant outlay for
professional legal costs, the Company anticipates it will undertake future enforcement activities
under contingency arrangements with legal counsel. Except for legal out of pocket expenses, legal
professional fees are typically payable upon successful recoveries. See Part&nbsp;I &#151; Item&nbsp;3. &#147;Legal

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">CTI competes with a number of companies that provide products and services that serve the same
function as products and services provided by CTI.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>EIM</I>. The delivery of multiple telecommunications services from a single provider requires the
service provider to present a single and comprehensive view of all of its services to the end
customer. Prior to the release of SmartBill<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Connect, the Company&#146;s value message to
the service provider focused on supporting the provider&#146;s enterprise customers who had complex
service mixes and difficult to manage billing hierarchies. As such, the Company competed in a very
narrowly defined niche. The Company found itself competing against electronic bill presentment and
payment providers whose web-based solutions were positioned as a single solution that could support
large users while delivering presentment and payment to the entire spectrum of end customers. With
SmartBill<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Connect, the Company maintains its previous functional capabilities while now
being able to scale functionality and deliver Internet-based presentment to the smallest of users.
The Company believes that it is now able to compete directly with providers of electronic billing
analysis and with providers of electronic bill presentment solutions. This combination positions
the Company as a provider of electronic invoice management that delivers content-and-capability
bundles that are defined differently for different market segments.

competitors may be larger and better capitalized than CTI. However, several telecommunications
companies offer a similar product using in-house resources. The Company&#146;s main source of
differentiation from its competitors, in the EIM segment is its technology. The Company has two
patents on its SmartBill<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> and SmartBill<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> Connect processes. These patents enable customer data to

operations.

many competitors which may be better capitalized than the Company. The Company&#146;s primary
competitors of SmartRecord<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP include Telrex, and Orecx. emPulse competes against hosted call

CTI differentiates itself through both technological advantages and pricing strategies.

Competitors, such as Mind CTI, BTS, Softech, Inc., Oak, Tiger, and Veramark Technologies, Inc.,

sector. The Company differentiates itself from its competitors based on reporting capabilities and
ease of user interface. Proteus<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> integrates with a wide variety of telephone systems and third

geopolitical economic and business conditions, conditions in the financial services markets, and
changes in the overall demand for networking products. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn
could adversely affect our customers&#146; financial condition and the levels of business activity of
our customers. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions could cause businesses to
postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The current economic crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the current
uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets, a
low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in credit, equity,
currency and fixed income markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from these economic
developments and negative economic trends on our business, including the inability of customers to
obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; customer insolvencies; decreased customer
confidence to make purchasing decisions; decreased customer demand; and decreased customer ability
to pay their trade obligations. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow additional funds under
our existing loan agreements and may not be able to expand our existing facilities if our lender
becomes in-solvent or its liquidity is limited or impaired. In addition, we may not be able to

automatic annual renewal provision effective each March, it does contain a 120-day prior
notification termination clause. The contract was automatically renewed in March&nbsp;2010. The loss

Although we have undertaken enforcement activities, including litigation, to protect or enforce our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have written letters and filed lawsuits claiming the possible infringement of our patents. We
entered into various settlements in prior actions and we may negotiate additional settlements in
the future. Those settlements provided substantial cash payments to us and, in return, we waived
our claims for past patent violations and granted in certain instances one time purchase of ongoing

&#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148; Although we strive to arrange for continued licensing revenue stream in the
case of potential infringers, we may not be successful in negotiating such licensing agreements.
Since those parties are our potential customers, the effect of granting one time purchase of
ongoing licenses as well as the fact that we brought legal claims against those parties could
reduce our ability to find new customers for our products which could have a negative impact on our

Europe, we face the uncertainty of not having previously done business in those commercial,
political and social settings. Accordingly, despite our best efforts, the likelihood of success in
each new market, which we enter, is unpredictable for reasons particular to each new market. For
example, our success in any new market is based primarily on acceptance of our products and
services in such market. It is also possible that some unforeseen circumstances could arise which
would limit our ability to continue to do business or to expand in that new market. Our potential

with these rules, broker-dealers participating in certain transactions involving penny stocks must
first deliver a disclosure document that describes, among other matters, the risks associated with
trading in penny stocks. Furthermore, the broker-dealer must make a suitability determination
approving the customer for penny stock transactions based on the customer&#146;s financial situation,
investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these determinations in
writing to the customer and obtain specific written consent from the customer. The effect of these
restrictions will probably decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market in our Class
A common stock, decrease liquidity of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and increase transaction costs for
sales and purchases of our Class&nbsp;A common stock as compared to other securities.

our Class&nbsp;A common stock has substantially less liquidity than the trading in the securities of
many other companies listed on that market. A public trading market in the securities having the
desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market
of willing buyers and sellers of our securities at any time. This presence depends on the
individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no
control. In the event an active market for the securities does not develop, you may be unable to
resell your shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at or above the price you pay for them or at any price.

filed a motion for stay and a summary judgment motion of invalidity based on the construction of
one of the claim terms. The motions were fully briefed on an expedited basis and on February&nbsp;26,
2008, the court denied the motions. Fact discovery closed on December&nbsp;23, 2008. Expert discovery
was completed on April&nbsp;1, 2009. On April&nbsp;15, 2009, the parties filed various summary judgment
motions related to patent infringement and invalidity and immunity from suit concerning the Networx
government contracts. On September&nbsp;22, 2009, the Court granted the Qwest entities&#146; motion for
summary judgment of immunity from suit concerning the Networx government contracts, thereby
requiring the Company to sue the Government in the Court of Federal Claims. On October&nbsp;29, 2009,
the Court ruled on the parties&#146; patent invalidity and noninfringement summary judgment motions. The
Court held that the Company&#146;s U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270 was valid but not infringed by the Qwest
entities. In November&nbsp;2009, the Company filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). The Qwest entities subsequently cross appealed.
Briefing before the Federal Circuit commenced February&nbsp;19, 2010 and is expected to be completed

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagment (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice Over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute such software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications expenses while driving
internal efficiencies into their invoice receipt, validation, approval and payment workflow
processes. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor
communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or
client bill back. These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade
products. Customers typically purchase the VoIP products when upgrading or acquiring a new
enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection,
enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates its revenues and cash from several sources: software sales, license fees,
processing fees, implementation fees, training and consulting services, and enforcement revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s software products and services are subject to changing technology and evolving
customer needs which require the Company to continually invest in research and development in order
to respond to these demands. The limited financial resources available to the Company require the
Company to concentrate on those business segments and product lines which the Company believes will
provide the greatest returns on investment. The EIM segment, as compared to the other business
segments, provides the predominant share of income from operations and cash flow from operations.
The majority of Telemanagement segment revenues are derived from the Company&#146;s United Kingdom
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that as voice and data services continue to commoditize, service providers
will seek alternative business models to replace revenue lost as a result of pricing pressures.
One such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted voice and video services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first being that organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second being that the
capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and average revenue per user advantage possible by delivering such
managed and hosted service offerings, providers not only look at acquiring new customers but
converting legacy customers onto the NGN platform. The Company believes that this conversion
process is significant. Many legacy features and functions are not available on NGN platforms,
primarily due to the immaturity of the service delivery model.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications will help eliminate customer resistance to conversion to next
generation platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the
delivery of compelling value added services. In 2007, the Company marketed two applications,
emPulse, web-based communications traffic analysis solution, and SmartRecord<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP, which enable
service providers to selectively intercept communications on behalf of their hosted and managed
service customers. These applications will also enable managed and hosted service customers of
service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor communications, and
perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or client bill back.
These applications were released as enterprise-grade products. The Company anticipates that
customers will purchase these products when upgrading or acquiring a new enterprise communications
platform. The Company has taken the business benefits of these enterprise-grade applications and
has delivered provider-grade managed and hosted service applications, enabling service providers to
create a new recurring revenue stream, while ensuring that enterprise customers have the tools
necessary and relevant to their particular line of business or vertical. The Company&#146;s future
success in the VoIP segment is directly related to the successful market penetration of emPulse and
SmartRecord<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> IP.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial Condition</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the stockholders&#146; equity decreased $1,232,243 from
$9,768,390 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 to $8,536,147 as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 primarily as a result of
the fiscal year 2009 net loss of $1,333,376. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents were
$508,836 compared to $341,936 at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Company realized a decline in net current
assets (current assets less current liabilities) of approximately $219,513 which was primarily
attributable to the increased borrowing of short-term debt to fund the Company&#146;s net loss.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates approximately 73% of its revenues from operations in the United Kingdom where
the functional currency is the United Kingdom pound. Revenues derived from operations in the United
Kingdom were negatively impacted in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to the reduction in the average
conversion rate. The average conversion rate for the United Kingdom pound into a United States
dollar for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 was 1.56 compared to 1.87 for the year ended December
31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Revenue</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Revenues from operations decreased $6,798,538 to $15,745,016 in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as
compared to $22,543,554 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Decreased revenues in 2009 were
experienced by the EIM, Patent Enforcement and Telemanagement segments offset by increases in the
VoIP segment. The EIM segment revenue decreased $3,272,979 which was primarily attributable to the
decrease in the average exchange rate of the United Kingdom pound into a United States Dollar and
reduced processing revenue from the Company&#146;s largest EIM customer. The Patent Enforcement Segment
recorded no revenue in 2009 as compared to $2,850,000 of revenue recorded in 2008 as a result of
the inability of the Company to secure a patent enforcement license or settlement agreement in 2009
despite on-going efforts. Telemanagement revenue decreased $989,579 to $5,011,097 in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $6,000,676 in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The decrease in
Telemanagement segment revenue was due to a decline in the revenue derived in the United States and
the decrease in the 2009 average exchange rate of the United Kingdom pound into a United States
Dollar. Revenue from the VoIP segment was $525,772 in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 which
represents an increase of $314,020 compared to $211,752 recognized in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2008. A major customer represented 18% of total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and
16% of total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, and such customer represented 18% of
software sales, service fee and license fee revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.

of products and services decrease, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was partially
off-set by an increase in research and development costs being allocated to cost of products due to
increased developer time being spent on customer specific projects as the Company continues to
focus on growing its professional services revenue. The Telemanagement segment cost of products
and services, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased $1,344 primarily due to costs
related to the exchange rate. The VoIP segment cost of products and services, excluding
depreciation and amortization, increased $31,042 primarily due to costs related to the increase in
revenue. For software sales, service fee and license fee revenues, the cost of products and
services, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 28.0% of revenue for the year ended December
31, 2009 as compared to 23.6% of revenue for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Patent license fee and enforcement cost for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 decreased by
$1,036,395 to $926,273 as compared to $1,962,668 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The
decrease was primarily related to a $904,010 decrease in contingent legal fees incurred in the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 when compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 as a result of the lack
of settlement revenue recognized in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.

December&nbsp;31, 2009 compared to $9,442,662 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Selling, general
and administrative costs decreased primarily due to elimination of incentive compensation accrual
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and the decrease in the average exchange rate of the United
Kingdom pound into a United States Dollar.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Research and Development Expense</I>
</DIV>

2009 compared to $3,644,930 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. The decrease in expense was
primarily due to an increase of $667,916 in development costs that were allocated to cost of
products due to increased developer time being spent on customer specific projects and the decrease
in the average exchange rate of the United Kingdom pound into a United States Dollar. The amount
of capitalized development costs related to internally developed software for resale was $1,092,963
and $838,493 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and
development expense relates primarily to personnel costs.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 increased $1,332 to $1,575,209
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $1,573,877 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. This
increase was primarily due to the amortization expense associated with VoIP and EIM internally
developed software. Approximately $600,345 and $421,371 of amortization expense was related to
capitalized software costs for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

$1,277,177, and cash provided by financing activities was $380,004 for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2009. Cash flow provided by operations of $970,119 was primarily attributable to the Company&#146;s add
back of non-cash depreciation and amortization of $1,575,209 which off-set the net loss of
$1,333,376. Cash flows used in investing activities of $1,277,177 related primarily to capitalized
costs incurred in the development and enhancements of the Company&#146;s products. Cash flows provided

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 of $1,333,376 was primarily due to
losses realized by the VoIP segment. Net loss realized from the VoIP segment for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $2,721,252.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s net income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 of $815,581 was primarily due to a
patent enforcement settlement of $2,850,000 being realized for the year. Net income realized from
patent enforcement activities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $953,008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from a single EIM customer. For the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had sales to this single customer aggregating
$2,849,514 (18% of total revenues) and $3,533,573 (16% of total revenues), respectively. Such
customer represents 18% and 18% of software sales, service fee and license fee revenues for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company had receivables from this single
customer of $213,254 (9% of trade accounts receivable, net) and $267,707 (10% of the trade accounts
receivable, net) as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively. The contract with
this customer contains an automatic annual renewal provision renewed automatically in March;
however, such agreement does contain a 120-day advance notice termination provision. The contract
with this customer was renewed in March&nbsp;2010. The loss of this customer would have a substantial
negative impact on the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has the following debt obligations (&#147;Loan Agreements&#148;):
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has a credit facility consisting of an acquisition loan and a revolving loan. The
document governing this credit facility is referred to as the &#147;Loan Agreement&#148;. During 2006, the
Company had available a revolving loan with National City Bank, a national banking association
(&#147;NCB&#148;) for the lesser of (a) $8,000,000, or (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic trade accounts
receivable, 90% of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable and 100% of cash placed in
a restricted account (the &#147;Revolving Loan&#148;). All borrowings are collateralized by substantially
all assets of the Company. On November&nbsp;13, 2007, the Company and NCB amended the revolving loan to
reduce the available amount that could be advanced under the Loan Agreement to $3,000,000 and to
remove the cash placed in a restricted account. Effective November&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company and NCB
entered into a Second Modification of Loan Documents (the &#147;Second Modification&#148;). The Second
Modification reduced the amount of the $2,600,000 acquisition loan (the &#147;Acquisition Loan&#148;) entered
into with NCB to $500,000 upon the Company&#146;s prepayment of $2.1&nbsp;million of the Acquisition Loan.
The Second Modification also modified the terms of the Revolving Loan to state that the sum of (a)
advances made on the Revolving Loan, and (b)&nbsp;any Company debt that is not secured by cash or a
letter of credit, may not exceed four times the trailing twelve (12)&nbsp;month consolidated EBITDA.
The revolving loan expires on December&nbsp;30, 2010, unless extended. Borrowings under the line of
credit bear interest (2.73% at December&nbsp;31, 2009) at LIBOR plus 2.50% payable monthly. The
amendment also changed certain financial covenants and borrowing availability under the revolving
loan. The outstanding balance on the revolving loan was $918,027 at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and $0 at
December&nbsp;31, 2008. The carrying amount of receivables, that serves as collateral for borrowings,
totaled $1,346,293 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and $1,561,652 at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Available borrowing
under the revolving loan at December&nbsp;31, 2009 amounted to $428,266.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Acquisition Loan was secured by a letter of credit from SEB Bank to NCB. The letter of credit
was secured by a guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British
Virgin Islands company (&#147;Fairford&#148;). As of March&nbsp;11, 2010, Fairford beneficially owned 64.0% of
the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock and director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole
beneficiary of a revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of
the Company, is the director of Fairford. Under the Second Modification, NCB removed the provision
in the Loan Agreement requiring that the Company obtain a letter of credit as security for the
Acquisition Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Modification, NCB executed a notice of
termination and release of the Letter of Credit dated November&nbsp;18, 2008. In connection with the
Second Modification, the Company issued to NCB an Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan Promissory
Note dated November&nbsp;18, 2008 (the &#147;Amended Acquisition Loan Note&#148;), which replaced the $2,600,000
note and reflected the reduced Acquisition Loan principal amount of $500,000. The Amended and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition and accounts receivable reserves, depreciation and amortization, investments, income
taxes, capitalized software, accrued compensation, contingencies and litigation. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Income Taxes. </I>The Company is required to estimate its income taxes. This process involves
estimating the Company&#146;s actual current tax obligations together with assessing differences
resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with
accounting guidance for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or
liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to be in effect when these
differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are assessed each reporting period as to whether it is more
likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income, including assumptions
regarding on-going tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is
uncertain, the Company will establish a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be
recovered. Changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax
provision in the statement of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company provided a valuation allowance against the Company&#146;s deferred tax
assets of the Company&#146;s net operating loss carryforwards in the United States net of certain
deferred tax liabilities. Given profitability from operations in the United Kingdom, deferred tax
assets related to the United Kingdom operations do not have a valuation allowance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with accounting guidance. A
tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the tax position
would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The
amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than not&#148; test, no tax
benefit is recorded.

activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design
specifications including, functions, features, and technical performance requirements.

annual tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired. There were no impairments
in 2009 and 2008. Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful
lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried
at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives
of the respective assets, generally 3-15&nbsp;years. Intangible assets consist of patents, purchased
technology, trademarks and trade names, and customer lists.

Solutions Limited. That entity is considered a separate reporting unit under accounting guidance
and the Company performed its annual impairment analysis on goodwill as of the October&nbsp;1, 2009, to
coincide with the calendar date set in past years for this analysis. The Company&#146;s analysis
considered the projected cash flows of the reporting unit and gave consideration to appropriate
factors in determining a discount rate to be applied to these cash flows. The Company engaged the
same outside firm as was used in past years to assist in this analysis. The Company is satisfied as
to the qualifications and independence of this firm with respect to their ability to assist in this
analysis. The results of this analysis indicated that there was no Step One impairment as of the
date of our annual impairment determination.

11, 2010, the Company&#146;s common stock closed at $.05 per share and the &#147;market cap&#148; for the
Company&#146;s stock was approximately $1.5&nbsp;million which is well below the Company&#146;s reported book

that impairment of its goodwill has occurred when the Company believes that generally accepted
valuation techniques using its most recent assessments as to the future performance of our business
indicate that goodwill is not impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Long Lived Assets. </I>In accordance with accounting guidance for accounting for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets, the Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its
long-lived assets, including intangible assets with definite lives. Long-lived assets are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying
amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates
there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future
cash flows.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Accounting guidance requires the periodic evaluation of capitalized computer software costs. The
excess of any unamortized computer software costs over its related net realizable value at a
balance sheet date shall be written down. The Company periodically evaluates capitalized computer
software costs for impairment. The Company had a net book value of $1,750,433 of capitalized
software costs as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Reserves. </I>The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policy is
consistent with accounting guidance on revenue recognition. In general, the Company records
revenue when it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from software licenses are
recognized upon shipment, delivery or customer acceptance, based on the substance of the
arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor
obligations to be fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured. Software sales revenue is
generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new
applications to existing customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in accounting guidance for software
revenue recognition Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training, consulting, and customization are
recognized as provided to customers. If the services are essential to the functionality of the
software, revenue from the software component is deferred until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth accounting
guidance. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the entire arrangement is accounted
for in conformity with guidance related to long-term construction-type contracts, using the
relevant guidance for accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production-type
contracts. The Company carefully evaluates the circumstances surrounding the implementations to
determine whether the percentage-of-completion method or the completed-contract method should be
used. Most implementations relate to the Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in
less than 30&nbsp;days once the work begins. The Company uses the completed-contract method on
contracts that will be completed within 30&nbsp;days since it produces a result similar to the
percentage-of-completion method. On contracts that will take over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company
uses the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable. In 2008, the Company established a reserve of $206,110 on a note receivable
related to patent license and enforcement revenues due to the insolvency of the debtor. In 2009,
the Company wrote off the note receivable against the reserve.

additional allowances may be required. Where an allowance for doubtful accounts has been

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued guidance on fair value
measurements. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance establishes a fair value
hierarchy about the assumptions used to measure fair value and clarifies assumptions about risk and
the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset. The guidance is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued additional guidance
which delayed the effective date for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except
those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) to
fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
adoption of the new guidance had no material effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements. In
October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued additional guidance which clarifies the application of the original
guidance in an inactive market and explains that when relevant and observable market information is
not available to determine the measurement of an asset&#146;s fair value, management must use their
judgment about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset in a current
sale transaction. Appropriate risk adjustments that a market participant would use must also be
taken into account when determining the fair value. Application of this guidance should be
accounted for as a change in estimate and was effective upon issuance. Upon adoption of this
guidance, there was no material impact on the Company&#146;s condensed consolidated financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of
activity for the asset and liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that
are not orderly. This guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in
the volume and level of activity, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same. Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market
participants. The guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there
has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in
relation to normal market activity. In addition, when transactions or quoted prices are not
considered orderly, adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be
needed to determine the appropriate fair value. The guidance also requires increased disclosures.
This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009, and
shall be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15,
2009. The Company adopted this new guidance in the second quarter, however, the adoption did not
have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on interim disclosures about fair value of financial
instruments. This guidance amends FASB&#146;s previous guidance on disclosures about fair value of
financial instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim
reporting periods of publicly traded companies that were previously only required in annual
financial statements. This amended guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending
after June&nbsp;15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The
Company adopted this amended guidance in the second quarter. See Note 3 of these Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events. This guidance establishes accounting
and reporting standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. The guidance became effective for fiscal
years and interim periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company adopted the new guidance during
the second quarter of 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on the FASB accounting standards codification and hierarchy
of generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance establishes the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification as the authoritative source of accounting principals to be used in the
preparation of the financial statements by nongovernmental entities. The guidance is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods ending after September&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company adopted this new
guidance during the third quarter of 2009. There was no material effect of the adoption of this
guidance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-5 to address concerns
regarding the determination of the fair value of liabilities. Because liabilities are often
not &#147;traded&#148;, due to restrictions placed on their transferability, there is typically a
very limited amount of trades (if any) from which to draw market participant data. As such, many
entities have had to determine the fair value of a liability through the use of a hypothetical
transaction. The ASU clarifies the valuation techniques that must be used when the liability
subject to the fair value determination is not traded as an asset in an active market. The ASU
would be applicable for interim or annual periods beginning after October&nbsp;1, 2009. The Company has
not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or
financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13 &#151; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements -
a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force applies to multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements that are currently within the scope of Topic 605-25. This ASU also provides principles
and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be
separated, and the consideration allocated, requires an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have
vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates the use of
the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
method. The consensus significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with
earlier application permitted. Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU on a
retrospective basis. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on
the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-14 &#151; Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
Elements &#151; a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force was issued concurrently with ASU
No.&nbsp;2009-13 and focuses on determining which arrangements are within the scope of the software
revenue guidance in Topic 985 and which are subject to the guidance in ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. This
ASU removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance and provides
guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible
product are within the scope of the software revenue model or the guidance in revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables model, ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. Generally, if the software
contained in or part of the arrangement with the tangible product is essential to the tangible
product&#146;s functionality, then the software is excluded from the software revenue guidance. The ASU
also provides factors to consider in evaluating whether the software was essential to the tangible
product or not. The disclosure requirements, effective date, and transition methods for this ASU
are the same as those for ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. An entity must adopt both ASUs in the same period using
the same transition method. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

CTI Group (Holdings) Inc.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. as of
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and
stockholders&#146; equity and comprehensive income / (loss)&nbsp;for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and
2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BUSINESS: </I>CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. and wholly-owned subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;CTI&#148;) design,
develop, market and support billing and data management software and services. The Company
operates in four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management, Telemanagement, Voice Over
Internet Protocol and Patent Enforcement Activities. The majority of the Company&#146;s business is in
North America and Europe.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s future operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could
affect future operating results and cause actual results to vary from historical results include,
but are not limited to: adverse economic conditions, risks associated with doing business outside
the United States, significant foreign currency fluctuations, restrictive loan covenants,
impairments may be recorded on intangibles, loss of its significant customers, inability to enhance
existing products and services to meet the evolving needs of customers, the Company&#146;s inability to
compete successfully, failure to enforce intellectual property rights, damage done to relationships
with potential customers by the Company&#146;s attempt to enforce intellectual property rights, the
Company&#146;s inability to successfully enter new markets, the Company&#146;s inability to maintain an
effective system of internal controls, control of the Company&#146;s stock is concentrated among
directors and officers, the Company is subject to penny stock rules which may adversely affect
trading of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, and there is not presently an active market for the
Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</I>: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;).
The FASB establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;) that
the Company follows. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(&#147;SEC&#148;) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC
registrants, which the Company is required to follow. References to GAAP issued by the FASB in
these footnotes are to the FASB <I>Accounting Standards Codification </I>(&#147;ASC&#148;), which serves as a single
source of authoritative non-SEC accounting and reporting standards to be applied by nongovernmental
entities. The FASB finalized the ASC effective for periods ending on or after September&nbsp;15, 2009.
Prior FASB standards like FASB Statement of Accounting Standards and FASB Staff Positions are no
longer being issued by the FASB. For further discussion of the ASC, see &#147;New Accounting
Pronouncements&#148; in Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations elsewhere in this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION</I>: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company&#146;s wholly owned United Kingdom-based subsidiaries. The financial statements of the
Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements and have
been translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with accounting guidance on foreign currency
translation. Assets and liabilities are translated at current rates in effect at the consolidated
balance sheet date and stockholders&#146; equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Revenue
and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the applicable period. Any resulting
translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive income. Included in
selling, general and administrative expenses is a transaction loss of approximately $17,000 for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and a transaction gain of approximately $4,000 for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS</I>: Cash and cash equivalents include the cash on hand, demand deposits and
highly liquid investments. The Company considers all highly liquid investments, with maturity of
three months or less, to be cash equivalents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>ADVERTISING COSTS: </I>The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. For the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, advertising expense was $170,367 and $116,234, respectively.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt">CTI GROUP (HOLDINGS)&nbsp;INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES<BR>
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>USE OF ESTIMATES</I>: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates utilized by the Company include the
determination of the collectibility of receivables, valuation of stock options, recoverability
and/or impairment of intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, accrued compensation and
other liabilities, commitments and contingencies, and capitalization and impairment of computer
software development costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</I>: The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist primarily of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, note and settlement receivables, accounts payable,
accrued expenses, and debt payable. At December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, the book values of these
financial instruments are considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to
the short maturity of these instruments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: </I>Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Furniture,
fixtures and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of three to five years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of the lease or the useful lives of the
improvements, whichever is shorter. All maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as
incurred.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</I>: Expenditures for producing product masters incurred subsequent to establishing
technological feasibility are capitalized and are amortized on a product-by-product basis ranging
from three to four years. The amortization is computed using the greater of (a)&nbsp;the straight-line
method over the estimated economic life of the product or (b)&nbsp;the ratio that the current gross
revenue for the products bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue of the
products. The accounting guidance requires the periodic evaluation of the net realizable value of
capitalized computer software costs. The excess of any unamortized computer software costs over
its related net realizable value at a balance sheet date shall be written down. See Note 4 &#150;
Property, Equipment and Software Development Costs. The Company capitalized $1,092,963 and
$838,493 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in costs related to its
software development. The amortization expense for developed software which relates to cost of
sales was $600,345 and $421,371 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: </I>The Company considers the goodwill and related intangible assets
related to CTI Billing Solutions Limited to be the premium the Company paid for CTI Billing
Solutions Limited. For accounting purposes, these assets are maintained at the corporate level and
the Company considers the functional currency with respect to these assets the U.S. dollar.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain
circumstances, and written down when impaired. There were no impairments in 2009 and 2008.
Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these
lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost, less
accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets, generally 3-15&nbsp;years. Intangible assets consist of patents, purchased
technology, trademarks and trade names, and customer lists.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>LONG-LIVED ASSETS</I>: The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived
assets, including intangible assets with definite lives using the methodology prescribed in
accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the
carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison
indicates there is impairment, the amount of the impairment is typically calculated using
discounted expected future cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS</I>: Costs relating to obtaining financing are capitalized and amortized over
the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method over the life of the debt.
Interest expense relating to the amortization of the deferred financing costs amounted to $103,671
and $203,766 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>REVENUE RECOGNITION: </I>The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements
set forth in accounting guidance for revenue recognition. In general, the Company records revenue
when it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from software licenses are recognized
upon shipment, delivery or customer acceptance of the software, based on the substance of the
arrangement or as defined in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor
obligations to be fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured. Software sales revenue is
generated from licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new
applications to existing customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s Telemanagement sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software.
Service revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in accounting guidance for software
revenue recognition. Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training, consulting, and customization are
recognized as provided to customers. If the services are essential to the functionality of the
software, revenue from the software component is deferred until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting. If the criteria for
separate accounting are not met, the entire arrangement is accounted for in conformity with
guidance related to long-term construction type contracts,. The Company carefully evaluates the
circumstances surrounding the implementations to determine whether the percentage-of-completion
method or the completed-contract method should be used. Most implementations relate to the
Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in less than 30&nbsp;days once the work begins. The
Company uses the completed-contract method on contracts that will be completed within 30&nbsp;days since
it produces a result similar to the percentage-of-completion method. On contracts that will take
over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company uses the percentage-of-completion method of contract
accounting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable. In 2008, the Company established a reserve of $206,110 on a note receivable
related to a patent license and enforcement revenues due to the insolvency of the debtor. In 2009,
the Company wrote off the note receivable against the reserve. The Company has the ability to
charge interest on past due accounts but typically does not charge interest.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO PATENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES: </I>Professional fees and legal costs incurred
while pursuing patent license fee and enforcement revenues are expensed as incurred. Legal fees
that are contingent on the successful outcome of an enforcement claim are recorded when the patent
license fee and enforcement revenues are realized.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>STOCK BASED COMPENSATION</I>: Under accounting guidance on share-based payment, the Company recognizes
the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock
options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>INCOME TAXES</I>: The Company accounts for income taxes following the accounting guidance for
accounting for income taxes, which requires recording income taxes under the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes
are recognized for the tax consequences of &#147;temporary differences&#148; by applying enacted statutory
tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is recorded based on a determination of the ultimate realizability of net
deferred tax assets. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Uncertain income tax positions are recognized as a benefit only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148;
that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being
presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than
not&#148; test, no tax benefit is recorded.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>BASIC AND DILUTED INCOME / (LOSS)&nbsp;PER COMMON SHARE</I>: Net income (loss)&nbsp;per common share is computed
in accordance with accounting guidance on earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss)&nbsp;per share is
computed by dividing reported earnings (loss)&nbsp;available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings (loss)&nbsp;per share is
computed by dividing reported earnings (loss)&nbsp;available to common stockholders by adjusted weighted
average shares outstanding for the year assuming the exercise of all potentially dilutive stock
options and warrants.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: </I>In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued guidance on fair value measurements. This guidance defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. This guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy about the assumptions used to
measure fair value and clarifies assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale
or use of an asset. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007.
In February&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued additional guidance which delayed the effective date for all
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the new guidance had no
material effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements. In October&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued additional
guidance which clarifies the application of the original guidance in an inactive market and
explains that when relevant and observable market information is not available to determine the
measurement of an asset&#146;s fair value, management must use their judgment about the assumptions a
market participant would use in pricing the asset in a current sale transaction. Appropriate risk
adjustments that a market participant would use must also be taken into account when determining
the fair value. Application of this guidance should be accounted for as a change in estimate and
was effective upon issuance. Upon adoption of this guidance, there was no material impact on the
Company&#146;s condensed consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of
activity for the asset and liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that
are not orderly. This guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in
the volume and level of activity, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same. Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market
participants. The guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there
has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in
relation to normal market activity. In addition, when transactions or quoted prices are not
considered orderly, adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be
needed to determine the appropriate fair value. The guidance also requires increased disclosures.
This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009, and
shall be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15,
2009. The Company adopted this new guidance in the second quarter, however, the adoption did not
have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on interim disclosures about fair value of financial
instruments. This guidance amends FASB&#146;s previous guidance on disclosures about fair value of
financial instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim
reporting periods of publicly traded companies that were previously only required in annual
financial statements. This amended guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending
after June&nbsp;15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March&nbsp;15, 2009. The
Company adopted this amended guidance in the second quarter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In May&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events. This guidance establishes accounting
and reporting standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. The guidance became effective for fiscal
years and interim periods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company adopted the new guidance during
the second quarter of 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In June&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance on the FASB accounting standards codification and hierarchy
of generally accepted accounting principles. This guidance establishes the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification as the authoritative source of accounting principals to be used in the
preparation of the financial statements by nongovernmental entities. The guidance is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods ending after September&nbsp;15, 2009. The Company adopted this new
guidance during the third quarter of 2009. The adoption had no material effect on the Company&#146;s
results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-5 to address concerns
regarding the determination of the fair value of liabilities. Because liabilities are often
not &#147;traded&#148;, due to restrictions placed on their transferability, there is typically a
very limited amount of trades (if any) from which to draw market participant data. As such, many
entities have had to determine the fair value of a liability through the use of a hypothetical
transaction. The ASU clarifies the valuation techniques that must be used when the liability
subject to the fair value determination is not traded as an asset in an active market. The ASU
would be applicable for interim or annual periods beginning after October&nbsp;1, 2009. The Company has
not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or
financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13 &#151; Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements -
a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force applies to multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements that are currently within the scope of Topic 605-25. This ASU also provides principles
and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangement should be
separated, and the consideration allocated, requires an entity to allocate revenue in an
arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have
vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates the use of
the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price
method. The consensus significantly expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. This ASU should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with
earlier application permitted. Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU on a
retrospective basis. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this ASU on
the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">FASB ASU No.&nbsp;2009-14 &#151; Software (Topic 985): Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software
Elements &#151; a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force was issued concurrently with ASU
No.&nbsp;2009-13 and focuses on determining which arrangements are within the scope of the software
revenue guidance in Topic 985 and which are subject to the guidance in ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. This
ASU removes tangible products from the scope of the software revenue guidance and provides
guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible
product are within the scope of the software revenue model or the guidance in revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables model, ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. Generally, if the software
contained in or part of the arrangement with the tangible product is essential to the tangible
product&#146;s functionality, then the software is excluded from the software revenue guidance. The ASU
also provides factors to consider in evaluating whether the software was essential to the tangible
product or not. The disclosure requirements, effective date, and transition methods for this ASU
are the same as those for ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13. An entity must adopt both ASUs in the same period using
the same transition method. The Company has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this
ASU on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain members of management. The terms
of these agreements generally include, but are not limited to, compensation, non-competition,
severance and change in control clauses. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, all relevant amounts
have been accrued for under these agreements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has the following debt obligations (&#147;Loan Agreements&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During 2006, the Company had available a revolving loan with National City Bank, a national banking
association (&#147;NCB&#148;) for the lesser of (a) $8,000,000, or (b)&nbsp;the sum of 80% of eligible domestic
trade accounts receivable, 90% of eligible, insured foreign trade accounts receivable and 100% of
cash placed in a restricted account (the &#147;Revolving Loan&#148;). All borrowings are collateralized by
substantially all assets of the Company. On November&nbsp;13, 2007, the Company and NCB amended the
revolving loan to reduce the available amount that could be advanced under the Loan Agreement to
$3,000,000 and to remove the cash placed in a restricted account. Effective November&nbsp;18, 2008, the
Company and NCB entered into a Second Modification of Loan Documents (the &#147;Second Modification&#148;).
The Second Modification reduced the amount of the $2,600,000 acquisition loan (the &#147;Acquisition
Loan&#148;) entered into with NCB to $500,000 upon the Company&#146;s prepayment of $2.1&nbsp;million of the
Acquisition Loan. The Second Modification also modified the terms of the Revolving Loan to state
that the sum of (a)&nbsp;advances made on the Revolving Loan, and (b)&nbsp;any Company debt that is not
secured by cash or a letter of credit, may not exceed four times the trailing twelve (12)&nbsp;month
consolidated EBITDA. The revolving loan expires on December&nbsp;30, 2010, unless extended. Borrowings
under the line of credit bear interest (2.73% at December&nbsp;31, 2009) at LIBOR plus 2.50% payable
monthly. The amendment also changed certain financial covenants and borrowing availability under
the revolving loan. The outstanding balance on the revolving loan was $918,027 at December&nbsp;31,
2009 and $0 at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The carrying amount of receivables, that serves as collateral
for borrowings, totaled $1,346,293 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and $1,561,652 at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
Available borrowing under the revolving loan at December&nbsp;31, 2009 amounted to $428,266.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Acquisition Loan was secured by a letter of credit from SEB Bank to NCB. The letter of credit
was secured by a guarantee from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford Holdings Limited, a British
Virgin Islands company (&#147;Fairford&#148;). As of March&nbsp;12, 2010, Fairford beneficially owned 64.0% of
the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock and director of the Company, is a director of Fairford and a grantor and sole
beneficiary of a revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of
the Company, is the director of Fairford. Under the Second Modification, NCB removed the provision
in the Loan Agreement requiring that the Company obtain a letter of credit as security for the
Acquisition Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Second Modification, NCB executed a notice of
termination and release of the Letter of Credit dated November&nbsp;18, 2008. In connection with the
Second Modification, the Company issued to NCB an Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan Promissory
Note dated November&nbsp;18, 2008 (the &#147;Amended Acquisition Loan Note&#148;), which replaced the $2,600,000
note and reflected the reduced Acquisition Loan principal amount of $500,000. The Amended and
Restated Acquisition Loan expired on December&nbsp;21, 2009 and the balance was repaid to the bank. The
outstanding balances on the Amended and Restated Acquisition Loan and the Acquisition Loan were $0
and $500,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Borrowings under the Loan Agreements are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on
indebtedness, encumbrances, investments, business combinations, and other related items. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. The more significant
covenants under the Loan Agreements, include that, without NCB&#146;s prior written consent, the Company
shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to: (i)&nbsp;incur or have outstanding any
indebtedness in excess of $20,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate; (ii)&nbsp;dispose of all,
or any part, of business or assets; (iii)&nbsp;make any acquisitions, or (iv)&nbsp;issue any additional
shares of stock or other securities and the Company shall not issue more than 10% of the Company&#146;s
capital stock pursuant to its stock option plan on a fully-diluted basis.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreements require the Company to pay a fee with respect to the unused portion of the
revolving loan of 0.25% per annum for each calendar quarter on the average daily amount by which
$3.0&nbsp;million exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the revolving loan during such calendar
quarter.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The revolving loan is secured by: (i)&nbsp;the Loan Agreement; (ii)&nbsp;the Guaranties dated December&nbsp;22,
2006 (collectively, &#147;U.S. Guaranties&#148;) from the Company&#146;s direct and indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries to NCB; (iii)&nbsp;the Security Agreements dated December&nbsp;22, 2006 (collectively, &#147;Security
Agreements&#148;) from each of the Company and its U.S. direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries;
(iv)&nbsp;the Charge Over Shares in from CTI Data to NCB dated December&nbsp;22, 2006; (v)&nbsp;the Debentures
dated December&nbsp;31, 2006 (collectively, &#147;Debentures&#148;) between NCB and each of the Company, CTI Data
and CTI Billing Solutions Limited; and (vi)&nbsp;the Guarantee and Indemnities (collectively, &#147;United
Kingdom Guaranties&#148;) between NCB and each of CTI Data and CTI Billing Solutions Limited.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s obligations under the loan documents, as defined in the Loan Agreement, are jointly
and severally guarantied by the Company&#146;s subsidiaries under the U.S. Guaranties. In addition,
pursuant to the United Kingdom Guaranties, each of CTI Data and CTI Billing Solutions Limited
guaranteed the Company&#146;s obligations under the Loan Documents and agreed to indemnify NCB for any
losses or liabilities suffered by NCB as a result of the Company&#146;s obligations under the Loan
Documents being unenforceable, void or invalid.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pursuant to the Security Agreements, the Company and each of its U.S. subsidiaries granted a
security interest to NCB in substantially all of their respective assets as security for the
performance of the Company&#146;s obligations under the Loan Agreement and, in case of the U.S.
subsidiaries, their respective obligations under the U.S. Guaranties. Under the Debentures, each of
the Company, CTI Billing Solutions Limited and CTI Data also secured their respective liabilities
to NCB.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Each of the Company and CTI Data entered into a charge over shares agreement with NCB pursuant to
which they granted a security interest to NCB, as further security for the obligations under the
acquisition loan and revolving loan, in all of the shares of the capital stock of CTI Data and CTI
Billing Solutions Limited, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the following events, among other circumstances, constitute an
event of default and may cause all obligations of the Company under each of the acquisition loan
and the revolving loan to become immediately due and payable: (i)&nbsp;any amount due under the Amended
and Restated Acquisition Loan Note and/or the Revolving Note is not paid within ten days of when
due; (ii)&nbsp;a default under any of the Loan Documents; (iii)&nbsp;any default in the payment of the
principal or any other sum for any other indebtedness having a principal amount in excess of
$10,000 or in the performance of any other term, condition or covenant contained in any agreement
under which any such indebtedness is created, the effect of which default is to permit the holder
of such indebtedness to cause such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and
(iv)&nbsp;any sale or other transfer of any ownership interest of the Company or its subsidiaries, which
results in any change in control of the Company or a change in the Chairman or Chief Executive
Officer of the Company.

tax rate in future periods. Consistent with the provisions of accounting guidance for uncertain tax

ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
tax planning in making these assessments. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had a valuation
allowance of $3,896,211 established against the U.S. deferred tax assets as utilization of these
tax assets is not assured in the United States. In addition, at December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company
considered its cumulative earnings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested.
Undistributed earnings at December&nbsp;31, 2009 are approximately $522,000 and if distributed in the
future, future United States taxes could be incurred.

the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase, and restricted stock grants
of, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Individuals eligible for participation in the
Plan included designated officers and other employees (including employees who also serve as
directors), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants who perform services
for the Company. The terms of each grant under the Plan were determined by the Board of Directors,
or a committee of the board administering the Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a change of control of the Company as
in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Stock options granted under the Plan typically become
exercisable over a one to five year period. Generally, the options have various vesting periods,
which include immediate and term vesting periods.

Securities Exchange Commission. Such registration statement also covered certain options granted
prior to the merger in 2001, which were not granted under the Plan (&#147;Outside Plan Stock Options&#148;).

In addition, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the Securities Exchange

Incentive Plan will continue to be administered under the Plan.

the Company or any of its subsidiaries and to determine the number and types of such awards and the
terms, conditions, vesting and other limitations applicable to each such award. In addition, the

Incentive Plan.

The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the
valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from
general practices used by other companies in the software industry and estimates by the Company of
the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for
periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant.

Class&nbsp;A common stock were granted at an exercise price of $0.09 per share to each member of the
Company&#146;s board of directors which consisted of Messrs.&nbsp;Birbeck, Garrison, Armitage, Osseiran,
Dahl, Reinarts and Grein. During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, options to purchase
200,000 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock were granted at an exercise price of $0.08 per
share to Mr.&nbsp;Hanuschek, the Company&#146;s Chief Financial Officer. The options vest ratably over three
years on the anniversary date of the grant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On February&nbsp;16, 2007, the Company and Fairford Holdings Scandinavia AB (&#147;Fairford Scandinavia&#148;), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Fairford, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement (the
&#147;Agreement&#148;), dated February&nbsp;16, 2007. Pursuant to the Agreement, on February&nbsp;16, 2007, the Company
issued to Fairford Scandinavia a Class&nbsp;A Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the &#147;Original Warrant&#148;) to
purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock (&#147;Common Stock&#148;) of the Company in consideration for
securing the issuance of a $2.6&nbsp;million letter of credit (the &#147;Letter of Credit&#148;) from SEB Bank to
National City Bank. Due to National City Bank&#146;s receipt of the Letter of Credit, the Company was
able to obtain the Acquisition Loan at a favorable cash-backed interest rate. Effective April&nbsp;14,
2008, the Company entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with Fairford Scandinavia and
issued an additional warrant to Fairford Scandinavia to purchase shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
based on the interest rate savings (the &#147;Additional Warrant&#148;). Pursuant to the Original Warrant,
Fairford Scandinavia is entitled to purchase 419,495 shares of Common Stock at the exercise price
of $0.34 per share, subject to adjustments as described in the Original Warrant, at any time prior
to the 10th anniversary of the date of issuance. Pursuant to the Additional Warrant, Fairford
Scandinavia is entitled to purchase 620,675 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at the exercise price of
$0.22 per share, subject to adjustments as described in the Additional Warrant, at any time prior
to the 10th anniversary of the date of issuance. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, Fairford beneficially
owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A common stock and Fairford Scandinavia owned
warrants to purchase 1,040,170 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the
majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and a director of the Company, is a director
of Fairford, the President of Fairford Scandinavia and a grantor and sole beneficiary of a
revocable trust which is the sole stockholder of Fairford. Mr.&nbsp;Dahl, a director of the Company, is
a director of Fairford and the Chairman of Fairford Scandinavia. The Original Warrant and
Additional Warrant vested immediately upon grant. The expense related to the Stock Warrants of $0
and $85,273 was recorded in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively,
as deferred finance costs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr.&nbsp;Osseiran, the majority holder of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and a director of the
Company guarantees all of the Company&#146;s debt. The Company incurred a non-cash charge $2,675

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in reaching a
reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company&#146;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (&#147;Internal Control&#148;) to determine whether
any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter (the Company&#146;s fourth fiscal quarter in
the case of an annual report) that have materially affected or which are reasonably likely to
materially affect Internal Control. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during
the quarter covered by this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary its
procedures and controls.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The management of CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f). The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company&#146;s management and board of directors regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
