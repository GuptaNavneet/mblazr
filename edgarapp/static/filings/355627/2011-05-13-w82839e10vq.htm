support billing and data management software and services. The Company operates in four business
segments: Electronic Invoice Management, Telemanagement, Voice Over Internet Protocol and Patent
Enforcement Activities. The majority of the Company&#146;s business is in Europe and North America.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company was originally incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1968 and reincorporated in the State of
Delaware in 1988, pursuant to a merger of CTI into a wholly owned subsidiary formed as a Delaware
corporation. In November&nbsp;1995, the Company changed its name to CTI Group (Holdings) Inc.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of the following business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagement (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute such software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage their telecommunications expenses while
driving internal efficiencies into their invoice receipt, validation, approval and payment workflow
processes. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor
communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or
client bill back. These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade
products. Customers typically purchase the VoIP products when upgrading or acquiring a new
enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection,
enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit,
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), and
reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of
the results for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Certain information in footnote disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, has been
condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, although the Company
believes the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and the notes thereto included in the Company&#146;s Form 10-K filed
with the SEC.

The FASB establishes accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;GAAP&#148;). Rules
and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of
authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants, which the Company is required to follow.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized once
the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable is

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company had a revolving loan with PNC Bank (&#147;PNC&#148;) which matured on December&nbsp;31, 2010 (the
&#147;Loan Agreement&#148;)
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Loan Agreement allowed for repayment to be made within ten days of the maturity date before a
default in debt would be declared. Outstanding principal under the Loan Agreement amounted to
$825,000 on December&nbsp;31, 2010. On January&nbsp;3, 2011, the revolving loan was repaid with an advance of
$825,000 from Fairford Holdings, Limited, a British Virgin Islands Company (&#147;Fairford&#148;), As of
March&nbsp;31, 2011, Fairford beneficially owned 63.7% of the Company&#146;s outstanding Class&nbsp;A common
stock. On January&nbsp;20, 2011, the board of directors approved the terms of Fairford&#146;s advancement
and the form of demand note. Subsequent to the advancement and approval by the board of directors,
the Company issued to Fairford a demand note, in the aggregate principal amount of $825,000 bearing
interest at LIBOR plus 4%.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In October&nbsp;2010, in order to supplement the Company&#146;s liquidity, Fairford advanced $500,000 to the
Company. Subsequent to the advancement, the Company issued to Fairford a demand note, in the
aggregate principal amount of $500,000 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 4%. The advances from
Fairford of $1,325,000 documented in the form of two demand promissory notes were repaid and
cancelled on May&nbsp;10, 2011. Accumulated interest under the promissory notes amounted to $23,919.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In March&nbsp;2011, the Company received a purchase order for EIM licenses in the UK totaling
approximately $6&nbsp;million and received payment of approximately $7&nbsp;million in May&nbsp;2011, which
includes VAT tax remittance. The EIM license agreement expands services provided to an existing
customer and the revenue will be recognized over the term of the three-year license and service
agreement. The license agreement does contain a termination clause which enables the customer to
cancel the agreement after two years of service and return 80% of the unearned prepaid license fee.
The maximum prepaid fee which could be claimed would be approximately $1.5&nbsp;million. The Company
believes that this source of liquidity along with the cash on hand, and anticipated increased cash
generated from future operating activities will be sufficient to support its operations over the
next twelve months.

consideration allocated, requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated
selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence or
third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an
entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. The consensus significantly
expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This ASU should
be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
fiscal years beginning on or after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with earlier application permitted.
Alternatively, an entity can elect to adopt this ASU on a retrospective basis. The adoption of
this ASU had no effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position.

within Subtopic 855-10. An entity that is an SEC filer is not required to disclose the date through
which subsequent events have been evaluated. This change alleviates potential conflicts between
Subtopic 855-10 and the SEC&#146;s requirements. ASU 2010-9 is effective for interim and annual periods

significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and the
presentation of separate information regarding purchases, sales, issuances and settlements for
Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, ASU 2010-6 provides amendments to subtopic 820-10
that clarify existing disclosures about the level of disaggregation and inputs and valuation

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011, outstanding stock options were excluded from
weighted average shares of common and common equivalent shares outstanding due to their
anti-dilutive effect as a result of the Company&#146;s net loss. Additional common shares to be issued,
assuming exercise of stock options for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011, would have been
154,479. For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, there were no additional common shares to be
issued, assuming exercise of stock options and stock warrants, since all options and warrants had
an exercise price higher than the average stock price for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) provided for
the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase, and restricted stock grants
of, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Individuals eligible for participation in the
Plan included designated officers and other employees (including employees who also serve as
directors), non-employee directors, independent contractors and consultants who perform services
for the Company. The terms of each grant under the Plan were determined by the Board of Directors,
or a committee of the board administering the Plan, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a change of control of the Company as
in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Stock options granted under the Plan typically become
exercisable over a one to five year period. Generally, the options have various vesting periods,
which include immediate and term vesting periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2002, the Company&#146;s stockholders authorized an additional 2,000,000 shares available for grant
under the Plan. In addition, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the
Securities Exchange Commission. Such registration statement also covered certain options granted
prior to the merger in 2001, which were not granted under the Plan (&#147;Outside Plan Stock Options&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;8, 2005, the Company&#146;s stockholders ratified the CTI Group (Holdings) Inc. Stock
Incentive Plan (the &#147;Stock Incentive Plan&#148;) at the Company&#146;s 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
In addition, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the Securities Exchange
Commission. The Stock Incentive Plan replaced the Plan. No new grants will be granted under the
Plan. Grants that were made under the Plan prior to the stockholders&#146; approval of the Stock
Incentive Plan will continue to be administered under the Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee is authorized to grant awards to
non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees of, and consultants and advisors to,
the Company or any of its subsidiaries and to determine the number and types of such awards and the
terms, conditions, vesting and other limitations applicable to each such award. In addition, the
Compensation Committee has the power to interpret the Stock Incentive Plan and to adopt such rules
and regulations as it considers necessary or appropriate for purposes of administering the Stock
Incentive Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The following types of awards or any combination of awards may be granted under the Stock Incentive
Plan: (i)&nbsp;incentive stock options, (ii)&nbsp;non-qualified stock options, (iii)&nbsp;stock grants, and (iv)
performance awards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The maximum number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock with respect to which awards may be granted to
any individual participant under the Stock Incentive Plan during each of the Company&#146;s fiscal years

in the Stock Incentive Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The aggregate number of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock that are reserved for awards, including
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying stock options, to be granted under the Stock Incentive
Plan is 6,000,000 shares, subject to adjustments for stock splits, recapitalizations and other
specified events. AS of March&nbsp;31, 2011, there were 1,644,468 awards available for grant under the
Stock Incentive Plan. If any outstanding award is cancelled, forfeited, or surrendered to the
Company, shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock allocable to such award may again be available for awards
under the Stock Incentive Plan. Incentive stock options may be granted only to participants who
are executive officers and other employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the day of
the grant, and non-qualified stock options may be granted to any participant in the Stock Incentive
Plan. No stock option granted under the Stock Incentive Plan will be exercisable later than ten
years after the date it is granted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At March&nbsp;31, 2011, there were options to purchase 5,861,782 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form option
valuation model (Black-Scholes-Merton formula) that uses the assumptions noted in the following
table. Because closed-form valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those
ranges are disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from historical
volatility of the Company&#146;s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and
employee termination within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar
historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of
options granted is derived from general practices used by other companies in the software industry
and estimates by the Company of the period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

obligations and no material claims with respect thereto were outstanding. The Company does not
expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and consequently, the

customer and the revenue will be recognized over the term of the three-year license and service
agreement. The license agreement does contain a termination clause which enables the customer to
cancel the agreement after two years of service and return 80% of the unearned prepaid license fee.
The maximum prepaid fee which could be claimed would be approximately $1.5&nbsp;million. The Company
believes that this source of liquidity along with the cash on hand, and anticipated increased cash
generated from future operating activities will be sufficient to support its operations over the
next twelve months. The advances from Fairford of $1,325,000 documented in the form of two demand

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is comprised of four business segments: Electronic Invoice Management (&#147;EIM&#148;),
Telemanagment (&#147;Telemanagement&#148;), Voice Over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) and Patent Enforcement
Activities (&#147;Patent Enforcement&#148;). EIM designs, develops and provides services and software tools
that enable telecommunication service providers to better meet the needs of their enterprise
customers. EIM software and services are provided and sold directly to telecommunication service
providers who then market and distribute such software to their enterprise customers. Using the
Company&#146;s software and services, telecommunication service providers are able to electronically
invoice their enterprise customers in a form and format that enables the enterprise customers to
improve their ability to analyze, allocate and manage telecommunications expenses while driving
internal efficiencies into their invoice receipt, validation, approval and payment workflow
processes. Telemanagement designs, develops and provides software and services used by enterprise,
governmental and institutional end users to manage their telecommunications service and equipment
usage. VoIP designs, develops and provides software and services that enable managed and hosted
customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data usage, record and monitor
communications, and perform administration and back office functions such as cost allocation or
client bill back. These applications are commonly available in the market as enterprise-grade
products. Customers typically purchase the VoIP products when upgrading or acquiring a new
enterprise communications platform. Patent Enforcement involves the licensing, protection,
enforcement and defense of the Company&#146;s intellectual property and rights.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company generates its revenues and cash from several sources: software sales, license fees,
processing fees, implementation fees, training and consulting services, and enforcement revenues.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s software products and services are subject to changing technology and evolving
customer needs which require the Company to continually invest in research and development in order
to respond to such demands. The limited financial resources available to the Company require the
Company to concentrate on those business segments and product lines which the Company believes will
provide the greatest returns on investment. The EIM segment, as compared to the other business
segments, provides the predominant share of income from operations and cash flow from operations.
The majority of Telemanagement segment revenues are derived from its United Kingdom operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company reported revenue in the EIM segment of $2.5&nbsp;million and $2.7&nbsp;million for the three
months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the Telemanagement segment, the Company
recorded revenues of $1.3&nbsp;million and $1.1&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and
2010, respectively. The Patent Enforcement segment recorded revenue of $0 and $40,500 for the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The VoIP segment recorded revenue of
approximately $245,837 and $120,146 for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that as voice and data services continue to commoditize, service providers
will seek alternative business models to replace revenue lost as a result of pricing pressures.
One such business model is the delivery of managed or hosted voice and video services.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Traditionally, organizations that required advanced voice and video services would purchase
enabling communications hardware and software, operate and maintain this equipment, and depreciate
the associated capital expense over time. This approach had two major disadvantages for such
organizations. The first being that organizations would experience significant capital and
operational expenditures related to acquiring these advanced services. The second being that the
capabilities of the acquired equipment would not materially improve as voice and video service
technology evolved.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Service providers recognized these challenges and began, as part of their next generation network
(&#147;NGN&#148;) strategies, to deliver managed and hosted service offerings that do not require the
customer to purchase expensive equipment up-front and virtually eliminate the operational
expenditures associated with managing and maintaining an enterprise-grade communications network.
Service providers incrementally improve revenue by enabling competitive voice and video features
while reducing costs by delivering these services on high-capacity, low-cost NGNs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Due to the profitability and average revenue per user advantage possible by delivering such
managed and hosted service offerings, providers not only look at acquiring new customers but
converting legacy customers onto the NGN platform. The Company believes that this conversion
process is significant. Many legacy features and functions are not available on NGN platforms,
primarily due to the immaturity of the service delivery model.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s VoIP applications will help eliminate customer resistance to conversion to next
generation platforms, while creating new revenue opportunities for service providers through the
delivery of compelling value added services. In 2007, the Company marketed two applications,
emPulse, a web-based communications traffic analysis

communications on behalf of their hosted and managed service customers. These applications also
enable managed and hosted service customers of service providers to analyze voice, video, and data
usage, record and monitor communications, and perform administration and back office functions such
as cost allocation or client bill back. These applications were released as enterprise-grade
products. The Company anticipates that customers will purchase these products when upgrading or
acquiring a new enterprise communications platform. The Company has taken the business benefits of
these enterprise-grade applications and has delivered provider-grade managed and hosted service
applications, enabling service providers to create a new recurring revenue stream, while ensuring
that enterprise customers have the tools necessary and relevant to their particular line of
business or vertical.

$5,230,794 as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 to $4,859,742 as of March&nbsp;31, 2011 primarily as a result of the
three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 net loss of $342,516. The Company realized an increase
in net current assets (current assets less current liabilities) of approximately $3,419,717 which
was primarily attributable to a large sale in the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At March&nbsp;31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents were $407,061 compared to $680,046 at December&nbsp;31,
2010, and such decrease was primarily attributable to cash provided by operating and financing
activities offset by cash used in investing activities. Cash provided by operating activities in
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 amounted to $342,974 which was primarily related to the net
operating loss of $342,516 being offset by depreciation and amortization of $444,649. Cash
provided by financing activities related to borrowings of $838,509 from a shareholder offset by the
pay-off of the Company&#146;s revolving loan facility of $825,000 during the three months ended March
31, 2011. Cash utilized in investing activities of $655,482 related to additions to property,
equipment and software. The Company generates approximately 78% of its revenues from operations in
the United Kingdom where the functional currency, the UK pound, has improved by 3.6% in relation to
the US dollar during the three month period ended March&nbsp;31, 2011.

principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition, bad debts, depreciation and amortization, investments, income taxes, capitalized
software, goodwill, restructuring costs, accrued compensation, contingencies and litigation. The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making

resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, a
deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates assumed to
be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse.

likely than not that they will be recovered from future taxable income, including assumptions
regarding on-going tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is
uncertain, the Company has established a valuation allowance for assets not expected to be
recovered. Changes to the valuation allowance are included as an expense or benefit within the tax
provision in the statement of operations. As of March&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company&#146;s valuation allowance
related only to net deferred tax assets in the United States. As a result, the Company&#146;s tax
expense relates to the UK operations and the Company does not anticipate recording significant tax
charges or benefits related to operating gains or losses for the Company&#146;s US operations.

tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to
occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely
of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the &#147;more likely than not&#148; test,
no tax benefit is recorded.

operations of the business unit are primarily based on recurring revenues and have not experienced
an adverse change in anticipated performance considered in the impairment analysis. The business
units operating performance subsequent to the goodwill impairment analysis has exceeded anticipated
performance through the most recent period that information is available. The Company believes

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company recognizes that the market for our stock is significantly below our book value which

sufficiently sophisticated to make a proper determination of the value of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
common stock such that it should drive the Company to reach a conclusion that impairment of its
goodwill has occurred when the Company believes that generally accepted valuation techniques using
its most recent assessments as to the future performance of our business indicate that it is not
impaired. The Company will continue in the future to be aware of the market cap in our assessment
of its goodwill and may more frequently update its analysis of goodwill impairment in light of this
situation. The Company believes the year-end analysis is sufficiently current and no formal
analysis has been performed at March&nbsp;31, 2011. If the Company assesses market condition changes in
our business, it may be required to reflect additional goodwill impairment in the future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Long-Lived Assets. </I>The Company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived
assets on an annual basis. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates there is impairment, the amount of the
impairment is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Reserves. </I>The Company records revenue when
it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from software licenses are recognized upon
shipment, delivery or customer acceptance, based on the substance of the arrangement or as defined
in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor obligations to be
fulfilled and collectability is reasonably assured. Software sales revenue is generated from
licensing software to new customers and from licensing additional users and new applications to
existing customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s sales arrangements typically include services in addition to software. Service
revenues are generated from support and maintenance, processing, training, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software and services, the
Company accounts for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple-element
arrangement. Amounts deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements. Support and maintenance revenues are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Revenues from processing, training,
consulting, and customization are

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">recognized as provided to customers. If the services are essential to the functionality of the
software, revenue from the software component is deferred until the essential service is complete.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If an arrangement to deliver software or a software system, either alone or together with other
products or services, requires significant production, modification, or customization of software,
the service element does not meet the criteria for separate accounting set forth in the guidance
related to software revenue recognition. If the criteria for separate accounting are not met, the
entire arrangement is accounted for in conformity guidance related to contract accounting. The
Company carefully evaluates the circumstances surrounding the implementations to determine whether
the percentage-of-completion method or the completed-contract method should be used. Most
implementations relate to the Company&#146;s Telemanagement products and are completed in less than 30
days once the work begins. The Company uses the completed-contract method on contracts that will
be completed within 30&nbsp;days since it produces a result similar to the percentage-of-completion
method. On contracts that will take over 30&nbsp;days to complete, the Company uses the
percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company also realizes patent license fee and enforcement revenues. These revenues are realized
once the Company has received a signed settlement or judgment and the collection of the receivable
is deemed probable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company continuously monitors collections
and payments from its customers and the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that the Company has identified. If the
financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Where an allowance for doubtful
accounts has been established with respect to customer receivables, as payments are made on such
receivables or if the customer goes out of business with no chance of collection, the allowances
will decrease with a corresponding adjustment to accounts receivable as deemed appropriate.

allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does
not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price, eliminates
the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
reaching a reasonable level of assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission&#146;s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company&#146;s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s principal executive officer and principal financial officer also conducted an
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting (&#147;Internal Control&#148;) to determine whether
any changes in Internal Control occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have
materially affected or which are reasonably likely to materially affect Internal Control. Based on
that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations to enhance, where necessary its
procedures and controls.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">The Company previously disclosed that on May&nbsp;11, 2004, an action was brought against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington by Qwest
Corporation seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of the
Company&#146;s Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. An amended complaint was filed on July&nbsp;13, 2004 adding
Qwest Communications Corporation to that action. The Company filed a motion with the United
States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking to dismiss that action
or, in the alternative, to transfer it to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Indiana.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">On November&nbsp;12, 2004, the United States District Court for the Western District of
Washington granted the Company&#146;s motion to the extent of transferring the action to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The Company asserted
counterclaims alleging patent infringement and the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Indiana then consolidated the transferred action with the pending
patent infringement lawsuit disclosed above under &#147;BellSouth Corporation et al.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">On January&nbsp;9, 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana
issued its claim construction for U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270. On January&nbsp;18, 2008, the Qwest
entities filed a motion for stay and a summary judgment motion of invalidity based on the
construction of one of the claim terms. The motions were fully briefed on an expedited
basis and on February&nbsp;26, 2008, the court denied the motions. Fact discovery closed on
December&nbsp;23, 2008. Expert discovery was completed on April&nbsp;1, 2009. On April&nbsp;15, 2009, the
parties filed various summary judgment motions related to patent infringement and
invalidity and immunity from suit concerning the Networx government contracts. On September
22, 2009, the Court granted the Qwest entities&#146; motion for summary judgment of immunity
from suit concerning the Networx government contracts, thereby requiring the Company to sue
the Government in the Court of Federal Claims. On October&nbsp;29, 2009, the Court ruled on the
parties&#146; patent invalidity and noninfringement summary judgment motions. The Court held
that the Company&#146;s U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;5,287,270 was valid but not infringed by the Qwest
entities. In November&nbsp;2009, the Company filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). The Qwest entities subsequently cross
appealed. Briefing before the Federal Circuit was completed, and, on January&nbsp;20, 2011, the
Federal Circuit reversed the district court&#146;s decision. On February&nbsp;22, 2011, the Qwest
entities filed a Petition for a Rehearing en banc. That Petition was denied on April&nbsp;25,
2011. The case will now return to the district court for trial, which is expected to occur
within the next year.
