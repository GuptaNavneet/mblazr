                         MARCH 31, 2009

(1)  The  condensed  statements included herein have been  prepared
     by  the  registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules  and
     regulations  of  the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  and
     reflect   all  adjustments  which  are,  in  the  opinion   of
     management,  necessary to a fair statement of the  results  of
     operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent  with
     the  annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these
     condensed   statements  consist  only  of   normal   recurring
     adjustments.   Certain information, accounting  policies,  and
     footnote    disclosures   normally   included   in   financial
     statements  prepared  in  accordance with  generally  accepted
     accounting principles have been condensed or omitted  pursuant
     to   such  rules  and  regulations,  although  the  registrant
     believes  that  the  disclosures  are  adequate  to  make  the
     information  presented not misleading.  It is  suggested  that
     these  condensed financial statements be read  in  conjunction
     with  the  financial statements and the summary of significant
     accounting  policies  and  notes  thereto  included   in   the

     Any  Net  Proceeds  of Sale, as defined, from  the  sale  or
     financing of properties which the Managing Members determine
     to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves,
     be  paid  in  the following manner: (i) first,  99%  to  the
     Limited  Members  and 1% to the Managing Members  until  the
     Limited  Members  receive  an amount  equal  to:  (a)  their
     Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 7%
     of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative
     but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed
     from  Net  Cash  Flow; (ii) any remaining  balance  will  be
     distributed  90%  to  the Limited Members  and  10%  to  the
     Managing Members.  Distributions to the Limited Members will
     be made pro rata by Units.

     For  tax  purposes,  profits  from  operations,  other  than
     profits  attributable  to  the  sale,  exchange,  financing,
     refinancing  or  other  disposition  of  property,  will  be
     allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the  Managing

(4)  Investments in Real Estate -

     On  December 17, 2007, the Company purchased a 38%  interest
     in   a  parcel  of  land  in  Fredericksburg,  Virginia  for
     $1,935,063.  The Company obtained title to the land  in  the
     form of an undivided fee simple interest in the 38% interest
     purchased.  Simultaneous with the purchase of the land,  the
     Company  entered into a Project Construction and Development
     Financing  Agreement under which the Company advanced  funds
     to  Silver-Honaker Development Company, LLC  ("Silver")  for
     the  construction of a Dick's Sporting Goods  store  on  the
     site.   On  March 12, 2008, the Company sold an 11% interest
     in the Dick's Sporting Goods property to AEI Income & Growth
     Fund  23 LLC, an affiliate of the Company.  The sales  price
     was  equal to the amount the Company had invested in the 11%
     interest,  so  no  gain or loss was recognized.   After  the
     sale, the Company's owns a 27% interest in the land and  was
     responsible  for  27%  of  the  construction  costs  of  the
     building.   The  Company's share of  the  total  acquisition
     costs, including the cost of the land, was $3,126,601.   The
     remaining  interests in the property were purchased  by  AEI
     Income & Growth Fund 24 LLC and AEI Income & Growth Fund  26
     LLC, affiliates of the Company.

     The  property is leased to Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. under
     a  Lease  Agreement  with a primary term  of  10  years  and
     initial  annual rent of $219,445 for the interest purchased.
     Pursuant to the Lease, the tenant commenced paying  rent  on
     May 8, 2008.  Pursuant to the development agreement, for the
     period  from  December 17, 2007 through May 7, 2008,  Silver
     paid the Company interest at a rate of 6.75% on the purchase
     price  of the land and the amounts advanced for construction
     of  the  store.  Pursuant to the Lease, any improvements  to
     the land during the term of the Lease become the property of
     the Company.

     In  November  2007, Kona Restaurant Group, Inc.  (KRG),  the
     tenant  of  the Johnny Carino's restaurants, approached  the
     Company  with a request to adjust the rent on the properties
     to   a   market   rental  rate  based  on  the  restaurants'
     performance  and the current conditions in the  market.   In
     March 2008, after reviewing the financial statements for the
     restaurants and KRG, the Company agreed to amend the  Leases
     to  reduce the current annual rent for the properties by 26%
     to  $217,395.  This amount is scheduled to increase annually
     by  1.5%. In addition, the amendments provide for additional
     rental  payments  if the restaurants' sales  exceed  certain
     stated  amounts.   In August 2008, the Partnership  received
     certification from Fired Up, Inc., the parent company of KRG
     and  guarantor  of the Leases, that it had achieved  certain
     expense  and  debt  reduction  measures  required   by   the
     amendments.   As  a  result,  the  amendments  will   remain
     effective for the remainder of the lease terms.

     operating  functions for the Company.  The  payable  to  AEI
     Fund   Management  represents  the  balance  due  for  those

(6)  Discontinued Operations -

     On  December  23,  2008, the Company  sold  5.0278%  of  the
     Applebee's  restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio  to  an  unrelated
     third  party.   The  Company received net sale  proceeds  of
     $191,947, which resulted in a net gain of $47,438.  The cost
     and  related  accumulated depreciation of the interest  sold
     was  $157,611  and $13,102, respectively.   The  Company  is
     attempting  to sell its remaining 94.9722% interest  in  the
     property.   At  March 31, 2009 and December  31,  2008,  the
     property was classified as Real Estate Held for Sale with  a
     book value of $2,729,702.

     The Company is attempting to sell the Sports Authority store
     in  Wichita,  Kansas.  At March 31, 2009  and  December  31,
     2008,  the property was classified as Real Estate  Held  for
     Sale with a book value of $3,158,350.

     During   the  first  three  months  of  2009,  the   Company
     distributed $50,505 of net sale proceeds to the Limited  and
     Managing  Members as part of their quarterly  distributions,
     which represented a return of capital of $1.19 per LLC Unit.

     The financial results for these properties are reflected  as
     Discontinued   Operations  in  the  accompanying   financial
     statements.   The following are the results of  discontinued
     operations for the three months ended March 31:

(7)  Fair Value Measurements - (Continued)

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value
     Measurements,"  ("SFAS  157"). SFAS  157  provides  enhanced
     guidance  for  using  fair  value  to  measure  assets   and
     liabilities.   In  February  2008,  the  FASB  issued  Staff
     Position (FSP) No. 157-2, which deferred the effective  date
     of  SFAS  157  for one year relative to certain nonfinancial
     assets  and liabilities.  The Company adopted SFAS  157  for
     financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 and  for
     certain  nonfinancial assets and liabilities on  January  1,
     2009.  The Company has no assets or liabilities measured  at
     fair  value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis  that
     would require disclosure under this pronouncement.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        This  section contains "forward looking statements" which
represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning  future
events, including statements regarding anticipated application of
cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the
sufficiency  of  cash  to  meet  operating  expenses,  rates   of
distribution,  and  other  matters.   These,  and  other  forward
looking  statements,  should be evaluated in  the  context  of  a
number  of  factors  that  may  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition and results of operations, including the following:

    Market  and  economic conditions which affect the  value
    of  the  properties the Company owns and the cash  from
    rental income such properties generate;

    the  federal  income tax consequences of rental  income,
    deductions,  gain  on  sales and other  items  and  the
    effects of these consequences for Members;

    resolution  by  the Managing Members of  conflicts  with
    which they may be confronted;

    the   success  of  the  Managing  Members  of   locating
    properties with favorable risk return characteristics;

    the effect of tenant defaults; and

    the  condition of the industries in which the  tenants  of
    properties owned by the Company operate.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

        The  preparation  of  the Company's financial  statements
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that  may
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and
expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets   and
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on  an  ongoing
basis,  including  those related to the carrying  value  of  real
estate  and  the  allocation  by AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.  of
expenses to the Company as opposed to other funds they manage.

       Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company purchased properties
and  recorded them in the financial statements at cost (including
capitalized acquisition expenses).  For acquisitions completed on
or  after January 1, 2009, acquisition-related transaction  costs
will  be  expensed  as incurred as a result of  the  adoption  of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), "Business
Combinations".    The   Company  tests  long-lived   assets   for
recoverability  when events or changes in circumstances  indicate
that  the  carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties
the  Company will hold and operate, management determines whether
impairment  has occurred by comparing the property's probability-
weighted   cash  flows  to  its  current  carrying  value.    For
properties   held   for  sale,  management   determines   whether
impairment  has  occurred by comparing the  property's  estimated
fair  value less cost to sell to its current carrying value.   If
the  carrying  value  is greater than the  realizable  value,  an
impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value  of  the
property  to  its realizable value.  Changes in these assumptions
or  analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value  of
the properties.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        AEI  Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each  of
the  funds  they manage primarily on the basis of the  number  of
hours  devoted  by their employees to each fund's affairs.   They
also  allocate  expenses at the end of each month  that  are  not
directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number  of
investors  in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative  to
other  funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these  expenses
subject  to  detailed  limitations  contained  in  the  Operating
Agreement.

        Management  of the Company has discussed the  development
and   selection  of  the  above  accounting  estimates  and   the
management  discussion  and analysis disclosures  regarding  them
with the managing member of the Company.

Results of Operations

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008,  the
Company  recognized rental income from continuing  operations  of
$534,429  and  $479,926, respectively.  In  2009,  rental  income
increased due to the acquisition of one property in 2008 and rent
increases on three properties, which were partially offset  by  a
reduction  in  rent  for  the  Johnny  Carino's  restaurants   as
discussed below.

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008,  the
Company  incurred  LLC  administration expenses  from  affiliated
parties   of   $89,743   and   $85,351,   respectively.     These
administration  expenses  include  costs  associated   with   the
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting
requirements and communicating with the Limited Members.   During
the  same  periods,  the Company incurred LLC administration  and
property  management expenses from unrelated parties  of  $14,391
and  $11,516,  respectively.   These  expenses  represent  direct
payments  to  third  parties for legal and  filing  fees,  direct
administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes,  insurance  and
other property costs.

        In  November 2007, Kona Restaurant Group, Inc. (KRG), the
tenant of the Johnny Carino's restaurants, approached the Company
with  a  request to adjust the rent on the properties to a market
rental rate based on the restaurants' performance and the current
conditions  in  the market.  In March 2008, after  reviewing  the
financial  statements for the restaurants and  KRG,  the  Company
agreed to amend the Leases to reduce the current annual rent  for
the  properties by 26% to $217,395.  This amount is scheduled  to
increase  annually  by 1.5%. In addition, the amendments  provide
for  additional rental payments if the restaurants' sales  exceed
certain stated amounts.  In August 2008, the Partnership received
certification from Fired Up, Inc., the parent company of KRG  and
guarantor of the Leases, that it had achieved certain expense and
debt reduction measures required by the amendments.  As a result,
the  amendments  will remain effective for the remainder  of  the
lease terms.

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008,  the
Company   recognized  interest  income  of  $1,628  and  $52,546,
respectively.   In  2009 interest income  decreased  due  to  the
Company having less money invested in a money market account  due
to  property acquisitions and lower money market rates  in  2009.
In  addition, the Company received $44,154 of interest income  on
construction advances in 2008.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        In  accordance  with  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal  of
Long-Lived  Assets",  upon complete disposal  of  a  property  or
classification of a property as Real Estate Held  for  Sale,  the
Company  includes the operating results and sale of the  property
in   discontinued   operations.    In   addition,   the   Company
reclassifies the prior periods' operating results of the property
to discontinued operations.  For the three months ended March 31,
2009,  the Company recognized income from discontinued operations
of  $137,467 representing rental income less property  management
expenses.  For the three months ended March 31, 2008, the Company
recognized  income  from  discontinued  operations  of   $120,077
representing rental income less property management expenses  and
depreciation.

        On  December  23, 2008, the Company sold 5.0278%  of  the
Applebee's  restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio to an  unrelated  third
party.  The Company received net sale proceeds of $191,947, which
resulted  in  a  net  gain  of $47,438.   The  cost  and  related
accumulated  depreciation of the interest sold was  $157,611  and
$13,102,  respectively.  The Company is attempting  to  sell  its
remaining 94.9722% interest in the property.  At March  31,  2009
and December 31, 2008, the property was classified as Real Estate
Held for Sale with a book value of $2,729,702.

        The  Company  is attempting to sell the Sports  Authority
store  in  Wichita, Kansas.  At March 31, 2009 and  December  31,
2008,  the property was classified as Real Estate Held  for  Sale
with a book value of $3,158,350.

         Management  believes  inflation  has  not  significantly
affected  income  from  operations.   Leases  may  contain   rent
increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over
a  specified period, which will result in an increase  in  rental
income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the
real  estate  to  appreciate in value.   However,  inflation  and
changing  prices  may  have an adverse impact  on  the  operating
margins  of  the  properties' tenants, which could  impair  their
ability  to  pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net  Cash  Flow
available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2009,  the
Company's  cash  balances increased $28,596 as a result  of  cash
generated  from  operating activities in excess of  distributions
paid  to  the Members.  During the three months ended  March  31,
2008,  the Company's cash balances decreased $633,365 as a result
of  cash used to purchase property and distributions paid to  the
Members  in  excess of cash generated from operating  activities,
which  were partially offset by cash generated from the  sale  of
property.

        Net  cash provided by operating activities increased from
$556,080  in 2008 to $573,748 in 2009 as a result of an  increase
in  total  rental  and  interest income in 2009  and  net  timing
differences  in the collection of payments from the  tenants  and
the  payment  of  expenses, which were  partially  offset  by  an
increase  in LLC administration and property management  expenses
in 2009.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        The  major  components of the Company's  cash  flow  from
investing activities are investments in real estate and  proceeds
from  the  sale  of real estate.  During the three  months  ended
March 31, 2008, the Company generated cash flow from the sale  of
real  estate  of $923,833.  During the same period,  the  Company
expended  $1,403,657 to invest in real properties  (inclusive  of
acquisition  expenses) as the Company reinvested  cash  generated
from property sales.

       On December 17, 2007, the Company purchased a 38% interest
in  a  parcel of land in Fredericksburg, Virginia for $1,935,063.
The  Company  obtained  title to the  land  in  the  form  of  an
undivided  fee  simple  interest in the 38%  interest  purchased.
Simultaneous  with the purchase of the land, the Company  entered
into  a  Project Construction and Development Financing Agreement
under   which   the  Company  advanced  funds  to  Silver-Honaker
Development  Company, LLC ("Silver") for the  construction  of  a
Dick's Sporting Goods store on the site.  On March 12, 2008,  the
Company  sold  an  11%  interest in  the  Dick's  Sporting  Goods
property to AEI Income & Growth Fund 23 LLC, an affiliate of  the
Company.  The sales price was equal to the amount the Company had
invested  in the 11% interest, so no gain or loss was recognized.
After the sale, the Company's owns a 27% interest in the land and
was  responsible  for  27%  of  the  construction  costs  of  the
building.   The  Company's share of the total acquisition  costs,
including  the  cost of the land, was $3,126,601.  The  remaining
interests in the property were purchased by AEI Income  &  Growth
Fund  24  LLC and AEI Income & Growth Fund 26 LLC, affiliates  of
the Company.

        The  property  is leased to Dick's Sporting  Goods,  Inc.
under  a  Lease  Agreement with a primary term of  10  years  and
initial  annual  rent  of  $219,445 for the  interest  purchased.
Pursuant to the Lease, the tenant commenced paying rent on May 8,
2008.  Pursuant to the development agreement, for the period from
December  17, 2007 through May 7, 2008, Silver paid  the  Company
interest at a rate of 6.75% on the purchase price of the land and
the amounts advanced for construction of the store.  Pursuant  to
the  Lease, any improvements to the land during the term  of  the
Lease become the property of the Company.

        The  Company's  primary  use of  cash  flow,  other  than
investment   in  real  estate,  is  distribution  and  redemption
payments  to Members.  The Company declares its regular quarterly
distributions  before  the  end of  each  quarter  and  pays  the
distribution  in  the first week after the end of  each  quarter.
The  Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from
quarter  to  quarter.  Redemption payments are paid to  redeeming
Members on a semi-annual basis.

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008,  the
Company   declared  distributions  of  $544,110   and   $601,550,
respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions
of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3%
to  the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of  Sale
were  allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing
Members.   The Limited Members received distributions of $528,797
and  $583,503 and the Managing Members received distributions  of
$15,313  and  $18,047  for  the years,  respectively.   In  2009,
distributions  were lower due to a decrease in  the  distribution
rate per Unit, effective October 1, 2008.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        During  the  first  three months  of  2009,  the  Company
distributed  $50,505  of net sale proceeds  to  the  Limited  and
Managing Members as part of their quarterly distributions,  which
represented a return of capital of $1.19 per LLC Unit.

        The  Company may acquire Units from Limited  Members  who
have  tendered  their Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
acquired  at  a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated  to
purchase  in any year more than 2% of the total number  of  Units
outstanding  on  January 1 of such year.  In no event  shall  the
Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion
of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or
operation of the Company.

       During 2009, the Company did not redeem any Units from the
Limited  Members.   On  April  1,  2008,  three  Limited  Members
redeemed a total of 190.71 Units for $136,054 in accordance  with
the  Operating Agreement.  The Company acquired these Units using
Net  Cash  Flow  from operations.  In prior years,  five  Limited
Members  redeemed  a  total of 224.77 Units  for  $169,626.   The
redemptions  increase  the remaining Limited  Member's  ownership
interest  in  the  Company.   As a  result  of  these  redemption
payments  and  pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the  Managing
Members received distributions of $4,207 in 2008.

       The continuing rent payments from the properties, together
with  cash  generated from property sales, should be adequate  to
fund  continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations
on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Economy and Market Conditions

       The impact of conditions in the current economy, including
the  turmoil  in the credit markets, has adversely affected  many
real   estate  companies.   However,  the  absence  of   mortgage
financing  on  the Company's properties eliminates the  risks  of
foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively  impact  the
value  and  distributions  of leveraged  real  estate  companies.
Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely  affect
the operations of the Company's tenants and their cash flows.  If
a  tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the Company's
income  would decrease, its distributions would likely be reduced
and the value of its properties might decline.

        Historically, the Company has sold properties at  a  gain
and  distributed  the  gain  proceeds  as  part  of  its  regular
quarterly  distributions,  and to make special  distributions  on
occasion.   The  remaining  sales  proceeds  were  reinvested  in
additional properties.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of  2008,
general  economic conditions caused the volume of property  sales
to  slow dramatically for all real estate sellers.  In 2009,  the
Company will likely complete fewer property sales than it has  in
the  past.   Until property sales occur, quarterly  distributions
going  forward will reflect the distribution of net  core  rental
income  and  capital  reserves, if any.  Distribution  rates  are
expected  to be variable and less than recent distribution  rates
until such time as economic conditions allow the Company to, once
again,   begin  selling  properties  at  acceptable  prices   and
generating gains for distribution.
