                             PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

        AEI  Income  & Growth Fund 25 LLC (the "Company"  or  the
"Registrant") is a limited liability company which was  organized
pursuant  to the laws of the State of Delaware on June 24,  2002.
The  registrant  is  comprised of AEI Fund Management  XXI,  Inc.
(AFM),  as  the Managing Member, Robert P. Johnson, the President
and  sole  director of AFM, as the Special Managing  Member,  and
purchasers of LLC Units as Limited Members.  The Company  offered
for  sale up to $50,000,000 of limited membership interests  (the
"Units")  (50,000  Units  at  $1,000  per  Unit)  pursuant  to  a
registration  statement  effective May  13,  2003.   The  Company
commenced   operations  on  September  11,  2003   when   minimum
subscriptions of 1,500 LLC Units ($1,500,000) were accepted.  The
offering  terminated  May  12, 2005 when  the  extended  offering
period   expired.    The  Company  received   subscriptions   for
42,434.763   LLC  Units.   Under  the  terms  of  the   Operating
Agreement,  the Limited Members and Managing Members  contributed
funds of $42,434,763 and $1,000, respectively.

        The  Company was organized to acquire existing and  newly
constructed  commercial properties, to lease such  properties  to
tenants  under  net  leases,  to  hold  such  properties  and  to
eventually sell such properties.  From subscription proceeds, the
Company purchased fifteen properties, including partial interests
in eight properties, at a total cost of $36,389,018.  The balance
of  the  subscription  proceeds was applied to  organization  and
syndication costs.  The properties are commercial, single  tenant
buildings leased under net leases.

        The  Company's  properties  were  purchased  without  any
indebtedness.   The  Company will not finance properties  in  the
future to obtain proceeds for new property acquisitions.   If  it
is   required  to  do  so,  the  Company  may  incur   short-term
indebtedness   to  finance  day-to-day  cash  flow   requirements
(including cash flow necessary to repurchase Units).  The Company
may borrow to finance the refurbishing of a property.

        The  Company will hold its properties until the  Managing
Members  determine  that  the sale or other  disposition  of  the
properties  is  advantageous in view of the Company's  investment
objectives.  In deciding whether to sell properties, the Managing
Members will consider factors such as potential appreciation, net
cash flow and income tax considerations.  The Company expects  to
sell some or all of its properties prior to its final liquidation
and  to  reinvest  the  proceeds from such  sales  in  additional
properties.  The Company reserves the right, at the discretion of
the Managing Members, to either distribute proceeds from the sale
of  properties  to  the Members or to reinvest such  proceeds  in
additional  properties,  provided that  sufficient  proceeds  are
distributed  to  the  Limited Members to pay  federal  and  state
income  taxes related to any taxable gain recognized as a  result
of  the  sale.  It is anticipated that the Company will  commence
liquidation through the sale of its remaining properties eight to
twelve years after completion of the acquisition phase, depending
upon the then current real estate and money markets, the economic
climate and the income tax consequences to the Members.

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.  (Continued)

Leases

       Although there are variations in the specific terms of the
leases,  the following is a summary of the general terms  of  the
Company's  leases.  The properties are leased to various  tenants
under  net leases, classified as operating leases.  Under  a  net
lease,   the  tenant  is  responsible  for  real  estate   taxes,
insurance,  maintenance, repairs and operating expenses  for  the
property.   For  some  leases,  the Company  is  responsible  for
repairs  to the structural components of the building, the  roof,
and  the  parking lot.  At the time the properties were acquired,
the  remaining primary lease terms varied from 13  to  20  years,
except for the Sports Authority and Dick's Sporting Goods stores,
which   had  remaining  primary  terms  of  11.2  and  10  years,
respectively.  The leases provide the tenants with  two  to  four
five-year   renewal  options  subject  to  the  same  terms   and
conditions  as  the primary term.  The leases  provide  for  base
annual  rental  payments,  payable in monthly  installments,  and
contain  rent  clauses  which  entitle  the  Company  to  receive
additional rent in future years based on stated rent increases.

Property Activity During the Last Three Years

        As  of December 31, 2005, the Partnership owned interests
in thirteen properties with a total original cost of $34,094,848,
including  acquisition expenses.  During the year ended  December
31,  2007,  the  Partnership  sold  two  property  interests  and
received net sale proceeds of $3,414,844, which resulted  in  net
gains of $360,083.  During the year ended December 31, 2008,  the
Partnership sold partial interests in two properties and received
net  sale proceeds of $1,115,780, which resulted in net gains  of
$47,438.   During 2006, the Partnership purchased two  additional
properties   for  $2,257,245  with  its  remaining   subscription
proceeds and property sales proceeds.  During 2007 and 2008,  one
property  was  purchased  for  $3,126,601  with  property   sales
proceeds.   As  of  December  31,  2008,  the  Partnership  owned
interests  in fourteen properties with a total original  cost  of
$36,071,323, including acquisition expenses.

        On September 26, 2006, Tia's Florida, LLC, the tenant  of
the  Tia's  Tex-Mex  restaurant in  Brandon,  Florida  filed  for
Chapter  7 bankruptcy, which leads to liquidation and dissolution
of  the  company.  The tenant closed the restaurant.  The primary
guarantor   of  the  Lease,  Julio's  Investors  LLC   (Julio's),
continued  to pay the rent and property expenses.  In the  second
quarter  of  2007,  the  Company  and  Julio's  entered  into  an
agreement  whereby  the Company would release  Julio's  from  its
Lease  guarantee in exchange for a lump sum payment of  $227,010.
This  payment  was contingent on completion of the  sale  of  the
property  and  was received on July 30, 2007.  The  property  was
sold on June 22, 2007.

Major Tenants

        During 2008, four tenants each contributed more than  ten
percent of the Company's total rental revenue.  The major tenants
in aggregate contributed 70% of total rental revenue in 2008.  It
is  anticipated  that, based on minimum rental payments  required
under  the  leases, each major tenant will continue to contribute
more than ten percent of rental revenue in 2009 and future years.
TSA Stores, Inc. will likely not continue to be a major tenant as
the  Company  is attempting to sell the property it leases.   Any
failure  of  these  major  tenants could  materially  affect  the
Company's net income and cash distributions.

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.  (Continued)

Competition

        The  Company  is  a minor factor in the  commercial  real
estate  business.   There are numerous entities  engaged  in  the
commercial  real  estate  business which have  greater  financial
resources  than the Company.  At the time the Company  elects  to
dispose  of its properties, it will be in competition with  other
persons and entities to find buyers for its properties.

Employees

        The Company has no direct employees.  Management services
are  performed for the Company by AEI Fund Management,  Inc.,  an
affiliate of AFM.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.

Investment Objectives

         The  Company's  investment  objectives  are  to  acquire
existing  or  newly-developed commercial properties that  provide
(i)  regular  rental income; (ii) growth in lease income  through
rent   escalation  provisions;  (iii)  capital   growth   through
appreciation  in the value of properties; (iv) reduced  occupancy
risks as a result of long-term leases with creditworthy corporate
tenants;  and (v) passive income that may be offset  by  eligible
passive  losses  from other investments for  tax  purposes.   The
Company does not have a policy, and there is no limitation, as to
the  amount or percentage of assets that may be invested  in  any
one  property.   However,  to the extent possible,  the  Managing
Members  attempt  to  diversify the  type  and  location  of  the
properties.

Description of Properties

        The  Company's properties are commercial,  single  tenant
buildings.  The properties were acquired on a debt-free basis and
are  leased  to  various tenants under net leases, classified  as
operating  leases.   The Company holds an  undivided  fee  simple
interest in the properties.

        The  Company's  properties are  subject  to  the  general
competitive conditions incident to the ownership of single tenant
investment  real estate.  Since each property is leased  under  a
long-term  lease, there is little competition until  the  Company
decides to sell the property.  At this time, the Company will  be
competing  with other real estate owners, on both a national  and
local level, in attempting to find buyers for the properties.  In
the  event  of  a tenant default, the Company would be  competing
with  other  real estate owners, who have property vacancies,  to
attract  a  new  tenant  to  lease the property.   The  Company's
tenants  operate in industries that are very competitive and  can
be  affected  by  factors such as changes in  regional  or  local
economies, seasonality and changes in consumer preference.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.  (Continued)

        The  properties  listed above with  a  partial  ownership
percentage  are  owned  with affiliates  of  the  Company  and/or
unrelated  third parties.  The remaining interest in  the  Johnny
Carino's  restaurant in Lake Charles, Louisiana is owned  by  AEI
Private  Net  Lease  Millennium Fund  Limited  Partnership.   The
remaining  interests  in  the  Jared  Jewelry  store  in  Madison
Heights,  Michigan are owned by AEI Income & Growth Fund  23  LLC
and  AEI Accredited Investor Fund 2002 Limited Partnership.   The
remaining  interest in the Jared Jewelry store in  Auburn  Hills,
Michigan  is  owned  by  AEI Income &  Growth  Fund  XXI  Limited
Partnership.   The  remaining  interests  in  the   CarMax   auto
superstore  are  owned by AEI Income & Growth  Fund  XXI  Limited
Partnership, AEI Income & Growth Fund 24 LLC and AEI Private  Net
Lease   Millennium  Fund  Limited  Partnership.   The   remaining
interest  in the Sports Authority store is owned by AEI Income  &
Growth  Fund 26 LLC.  The remaining interest in the Advance  Auto
Parts  store  in Indianapolis, Indiana is owned by AEI  Income  &
Growth Fund XXII Limited Partnership.  The remaining interests in
the  Dick's Sporting Goods store are owned by AEI Income & Growth
Fund  23  LLC, AEI Income & Growth Fund 24 LLC and AEI  Income  &
Growth  Fund  26  LLC.  The remaining interest in the  Applebee's
restaurant is owned by an unrelated third party.

        The  Company accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-
common  with  affiliated entities and/or unrelated third  parties
using  the  proportionate consolidation method.  Each  tenant-in-
common  owns  a  separate, undivided interest in the  properties.
Any tenant-in-common that holds more than a 50% interest does not
control decisions over the other tenant-in-common interests.  The
financial statements reflect only this Company's percentage share
of  the  properties'  land, building and equipment,  liabilities,
revenues and expenses.

        At  the  time the properties were acquired, the remaining
primary  lease terms varied from 13 to 20 years, except  for  the
Sports  Authority  and Dick's Sporting Goods  stores,  which  had
remaining primary terms of 11.2 and 10 years, respectively.   The
leases  provide  the tenants with two to four  five-year  renewal
options  subject to the same terms and conditions as the  primary
term.

       Pursuant to the lease agreements, the tenants are required
to provide proof of adequate insurance coverage on the properties
they  occupy.   The Managing Members believe the  properties  are
adequately covered by insurance and consider the properties to be
well-maintained and sufficient for the Company's operations.

       For tax purposes, the Company's properties are depreciated
under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS).  The
largest depreciable component of a property is the building which
is  depreciated, using the straight-line method, over  39  years.
The  remaining depreciable components of a property are  personal
property  and land improvements which are depreciated,  using  an
accelerated method, over 5 and 15 years, respectively.  Since the
Company  has  tax-exempt Members, the Company is subject  to  the
rules  of  Section 168(h)(6) of the Internal Revenue  Code  which
requires  a  percentage of the properties' depreciable components
to  be  depreciated  over  longer lives using  the  straight-line
method.  In general, the federal tax basis of the properties  for
tax  depreciation purposes will be the same as the basis for book
depreciation purposes.

        At  December 31, 2008, all properties listed  above  were
100% occupied.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK-
         HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

        (a) As of December 31, 2008, there were 1,134 holders  of
record of the registrant's LLC Units.  There is no other class of
security  outstanding or authorized.  The registrant's Units  are
not  a  traded security in any market.  During the period covered
by  this  report, the Company did not sell any equity  securities
that are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

       Cash distributions of $67,786 and $74,506 were made to the
Managing Members and $2,279,298 and $2,519,455 were made  to  the
Limited   Members   for   2008  and  2007,   respectively.    The
distributions  were made on a quarterly basis and  represent  Net
Cash   Flow,  as  defined,  except  as  discussed  below.   These
distributions  should  not be compared  with  dividends  paid  on
capital stock by corporations.

        As  part  of the Limited Members' distributions discussed
above, the Company distributed net sale proceeds of $130,000  and
$164,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

       (b) Not applicable.

        (c)  Pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Operating  Agreement,
each Limited Member has the right to present Units to the Company
for  purchase by submitting notice to the Managing Member  during
January or July of each year.  The purchase price of the Units is
equal  to  80% of the net asset value per Unit, as of  the  first
business  day  of January or July of each year, as determined  by
the  Managing  Member in accordance with the  provisions  of  the
Operating  Agreement.   Units  tendered  to  the  Company  during
January  and  July  are redeemed on April 1st  and  October  1st,
respectively, of each year subject to the following  limitations.
The  Company will not be obligated to purchase in any  year  more
than 2% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1  of
such  year.   In  no  event  shall the Company  be  obligated  to
purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member,
such  purchase  would  impair the capital  or  operation  of  the
Company.   During the last three months of 2008, the Company  did
not purchase any Units.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK-
         HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Other Information

        The Company is required, pursuant to FINRA Rule 2810,  to
disclose  in each annual report distributed to Limited Members  a
per  Unit  estimated value, the method by which it was  developed
and the date of the data used to develop the estimated value.  At
December 31, 2008, the Company's Units were valued at $886.  This
value  was the aggregate estimated value of the Company's  assets
less  the  Company's liabilities, and less the value attributable
to the interest of the Managing Members, divided by the number of
Units   outstanding.    The  Company's  cash,   receivables   and
liabilities  were  valued at face value.  Each of  the  Company's
properties  were  valued  by  dividing  their  rental  income  on
December  1,  2008 by a capitalization rate the  Managing  Member
believed  to be representative of the retail market for the  sale
of  each  property.   No  independent  property  appraisals  were
obtained.   The valuations performed by the Managing Member  were
estimates  only, and were based on a number of assumptions  which
may  not  be accurate or complete.  In addition, property  values
are  subject  to change and could decline after the date  of  the
valuations.  Accordingly, this estimated value, prepared  by  the
Managing  Member, should not be viewed as the amount at  which  a
Limited Member may be able to sell his units, or the fair  market
value of the Company properties, nor does it represent the amount
of  net  proceeds Limited Members would receive  if  the  Company
properties   were  sold  and  the  proceeds  distributed   in   a
liquidation of the Company.

ITEM 6.   SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

       Not required for a smaller reporting company.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        This  section contains "forward looking statements" which
represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning  future
events, including statements regarding anticipated application of
cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the
sufficiency  of  cash  to  meet  operating  expenses,  rates   of
distribution,  and  other  matters.   These,  and  other  forward
looking  statements,  should be evaluated in  the  context  of  a
number  of  factors  that  may  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition and results of operations, including the following:

    Market  and  economic conditions which affect the  value
    of  the  properties the Company owns and the cash  from
    rental income such properties generate;

    the  federal  income tax consequences of rental  income,
    deductions,  gain  on  sales and other  items  and  the
    effects of these consequences for Members;

    resolution  by  the Managing Members of  conflicts  with
    which they may be confronted;

    the   success  of  the  Managing  Members  of   locating
    properties with favorable risk return characteristics;
    the effect of tenant defaults; and

    the  condition of the industries in which the  tenants  of
    properties owned by the Company operate.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

        The  preparation  of  the Company's financial  statements
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that  may
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and
expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets   and
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on  an  ongoing
basis,  including  those related to the carrying  value  of  real
estate  and  the  allocation  by AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.  of
expenses to the Company as opposed to other funds they manage.

        The Company purchases properties and records them in  the
financial  statements at cost (including capitalized  acquisition
expenses).    The  Company  anticipates  that  for   acquisitions
completed  on  or  after  January  1,  2009,  acquisition-related
transaction costs will be expensed as incurred as a result of the
adoption  of  Statement  of  Financial Accounting  Standards  No.
141(R),  Business  Combinations.  The  Company  tests  long-lived
assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances
indicate  that  the carrying value may not be  recoverable.   For
properties   the  Company  will  hold  and  operate,   management
determines  whether  impairment has  occurred  by  comparing  the
property's   probability-weighted  cash  flows  to  its   current
carrying   value.   For  properties  held  for  sale,  management
determines  whether  impairment has  occurred  by  comparing  the
property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its  current
carrying  value.   If  the carrying value  is  greater  than  the
realizable  value, an impairment loss is recorded to  reduce  the
carrying value of the property to its realizable value.   Changes
in  these  assumptions or analysis may cause material changes  in
the carrying value of the properties.

        AEI  Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each  of
the  funds  they manage primarily on the basis of the  number  of
hours  devoted  by their employees to each fund's affairs.   They
also  allocate  expenses at the end of each month  that  are  not
directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number  of
investors  in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative  to
other  funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these  expenses
subject  to  detailed  limitations  contained  in  the  Operating
Agreement.

        Management  of the Company has discussed the  development
and   selection  of  the  above  accounting  estimates  and   the
management  discussion  and analysis disclosures  regarding  them
with the managing member of the Company.

Results of Operations

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2008  and  2007,  the
Company  recognized rental income from continuing  operations  of
$2,035,349 and $1,943,620, respectively.  In 2008, rental  income
increased due to the acquisition of one property in 2008 and rent
increases on three properties, which were partially offset  by  a
reduction  in  rent  for  the  Johnny  Carino's  restaurants   as
discussed below.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2008  and  2007,  the
Company  incurred  LLC  administration expenses  from  affiliated
parties   of   $399,530   and  $351,807,   respectively.    These
administration  expenses  include  costs  associated   with   the
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting
requirements  and communicating with the Limited Members.   These
expenses  were higher in 2008, when compared to 2007, mainly  due
to additional expenses related to property sale activities in the
second  half  of  2008.   During the same  periods,  the  Company
incurred LLC administration and property management expenses from
unrelated  parties  of $41,300 and $48,822, respectively.   These
expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and
filing  fees,  direct administrative costs, outside audit  costs,
taxes, insurance and other property costs.

        In  November 2007, Kona Restaurant Group, Inc. (KRG), the
tenant of the Johnny Carino's restaurants, approached the Company
with  a  request to adjust the rent on the properties to a market
rental rate based on the restaurants' performance and the current
conditions  in  the market.  In March 2008, after  reviewing  the
financial  statements for the restaurants and  KRG,  the  Company
agreed to amend the Leases to reduce the current annual rent  for
the  properties by 26% to $217,395.  This amount is scheduled  to
increase  annually  by 1.5%. In addition, the amendments  provide
for  additional rental payments if the restaurants' sales  exceed
certain stated amounts.  In August 2008, the Partnership received
certification from Fired Up, Inc., the parent company of KRG  and
guarantor of the Leases, that it had achieved certain expense and
debt reduction measures required by the amendments.  As a result,
the  amendments  will remain effective for the remainder  of  the
lease terms.

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2008  and  2007,  the
Company  recognized  interest income  of  $77,093  and  $103,763,
respectively.   In  2008, interest income decreased  due  to  the
Partnership having less money invested in a money market  account
due  to  property  acquisitions and lower money  market  interest
rates  in  2008,  when  compared to 2007.  These  decreases  were
partially  offset by additional interest received on construction
advances in 2008.

        In  accordance  with  Statement of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal  of
Long-Lived  Assets,  upon  complete disposal  of  a  property  or
classification of a property as Real Estate Held  for  Sale,  the
Company  includes the operating results and sale of the  property
in   discontinued   operations.    In   addition,   the   Company
reclassifies the prior periods' operating results of the property
to  discontinued  operations.  For the year  ended  December  31,
2008,  the Company recognized income from discontinued operations
of  $523,627 representing rental income less property  management
expenses  and  depreciation of $476,189 and gain on  disposal  of
real  estate of $47,438.  For the year ended December  31,  2007,
the  Company  recognized income from discontinued  operations  of
$1,113,913  representing rental and lease settlement income  less
property  management expenses and depreciation  of  $753,830  and
gain on disposal of real estate of $360,083.

        On September 26, 2006, Tia's Florida, LLC, the tenant  of
the  Tia's  Tex-Mex  restaurant in  Brandon,  Florida  filed  for
Chapter  7 bankruptcy, which leads to liquidation and dissolution
of  the  company.  The tenant closed the restaurant.  The primary
guarantor   of  the  Lease,  Julio's  Investors  LLC   (Julio's),
continued  to pay the rent and property expenses.  In the  second
quarter  of  2007,  the  Company  and  Julio's  entered  into  an
agreement  whereby  the Company would release  Julio's  from  its
Lease  guarantee in exchange for a lump sum payment of  $227,010.
This  payment  was contingent on completion of the  sale  of  the
property and was received on July 30, 2007.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        On  June  22,  2007, the Company sold the  Tia's  Tex-Mex
restaurant in Brandon, Florida to an unrelated third party.   The
Company  received net sale proceeds of $2,163,779, which resulted
in  a  net  gain of $31,931.  At the time of sale, the  cost  and
related  accumulated  depreciation was $2,261,506  and  $129,658,
respectively.

       During the third quarter of 2007, the Company sold its 25%
interest in the Jared Jewelry store in Goodlettsville, Tennessee,
in  four separate transactions, to unrelated third parties.   The
Company  received  total net sale proceeds of  $1,251,065,  which
resulted  in  a  net  gain of $328,152.   The  cost  and  related
accumulated  depreciation of the interests sold was $988,254  and
$65,341, respectively.

        On  December  23, 2008, the Company sold 5.0278%  of  the
Applebee's  restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio to an  unrelated  third
party.  The Company received net sale proceeds of $191,947, which
resulted  in  a  net  gain  of $47,438.   The  cost  and  related
accumulated  depreciation of the interest sold was  $157,611  and
$13,102,  respectively.  The Company is attempting  to  sell  its
remaining  94.9722% interest in the property.   At  December  31,
2008,  the property was classified as Real Estate Held  for  Sale
with a book value of $2,729,702.

        The  Company  is attempting to sell the Sports  Authority
store  in  Wichita, Kansas.  At December 31, 2008 and  2007,  the
property was classified as Real Estate Held for Sale with a  book
value of $3,158,350.

         Management  believes  inflation  has  not  significantly
affected  income  from  operations.   Leases  may  contain   rent
increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over
a  specified period, which will result in an increase  in  rental
income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the
real  estate  to  appreciate in value.   However,  inflation  and
changing  prices  may  have an adverse impact  on  the  operating
margins  of  the  properties' tenants, which could  impair  their
ability  to  pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net  Cash  Flow
available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During  the  year ended December 31, 2008, the  Company's
cash  balances decreased $1,376,307 as a result of cash  used  to
purchase property and distributions paid to the Members in excess
of cash generated from operating activities, which were partially
offset  by cash generated from the sale of property.  During  the
year  ended  December  31,  2007,  the  Company's  cash  balances
increased $1,390,952 as a result of cash generated from the  sale
of  property, which was partially offset by cash used to purchase
property and distributions paid to the Members in excess of  cash
generated from operating activities.

        Net  cash provided by operating activities decreased from
$2,576,163  in  2007  to $2,222,283 in 2008  as  a  result  of  a
decrease  in  total  income  in  2008  and  an  increase  in  LLC
administration  and property management expenses in  2008,  which
were partially offset by net timing differences in the collection
of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        The  major  components of the Company's  cash  flow  from
investing activities are investments in real estate and  proceeds
from  the  sale of real estate.  During the years ended  December
31,  2008 and 2007, the Company generated cash flow from the sale
of  real  estate  of  $1,115,780  and  $3,414,844,  respectively.
During  the  years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the  Company
expended  $2,062,557 and 1,987,877, respectively,  to  invest  in
real  properties  (inclusive  of  acquisition  expenses)  as  the
Company reinvested cash generated from property sales.

       On December 17, 2007, the Company purchased a 38% interest
in  a  parcel of land in Fredericksburg, Virginia for $1,935,063.
The  Company  obtained  title to the  land  in  the  form  of  an
undivided  fee  simple  interest in the 38%  interest  purchased.
Simultaneous  with the purchase of the land, the Company  entered
into  a  Project Construction and Development Financing Agreement
under   which   the  Company  advanced  funds  to  Silver-Honaker
Development  Company, LLC ("Silver") for the  construction  of  a
Dick's Sporting Goods store on the site.  On March 12, 2008,  the
Company  sold  an  11%  interest in  the  Dick's  Sporting  Goods
property to AEI Income & Growth Fund 23 LLC, an affiliate of  the
Company.  The sales price was equal to the amount the Company had
invested  in the 11% interest, so no gain or loss was recognized.
After the sale, the Company's owns a 27% interest in the land and
was  responsible  for  27%  of  the  construction  costs  of  the
building.   The  Company's share of the total acquisition  costs,
including  the  cost of the land, was $3,126,601.  The  remaining
interests in the property were purchased by AEI Income  &  Growth
Fund  24  LLC and AEI Income & Growth Fund 26 LLC, affiliates  of
the Company.

        The  property  is leased to Dick's Sporting  Goods,  Inc.
under  a  Lease  Agreement with a primary term of  10  years  and
initial  annual  rent  of  $219,445 for the  interest  purchased.
Pursuant to the Lease, the tenant commenced paying rent on May 8,
2008.  Pursuant to the development agreement, for the period from
December  17, 2007 through May 7, 2008, Silver paid  the  Company
interest at a rate of 6.75% on the purchase price of the land and
the amounts advanced for construction of the store.  Pursuant  to
the  Lease, any improvements to the land during the term  of  the
Lease become the property of the Company.

        The  Company's  primary  use of  cash  flow,  other  than
investment   in  real  estate,  is  distribution  and  redemption
payments  to Members.  The Company declares its regular quarterly
distributions  before  the  end of  each  quarter  and  pays  the
distribution  in  the first week after the end of  each  quarter.
The  Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from
quarter  to  quarter.  Redemption payments are paid to  redeeming
Members on a semi-annual basis.

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2008  and  2007,  the
Company  declared  distributions of  $2,347,084  and  $2,593,961,
respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions
of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3%
to  the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of  Sale
were  allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing
Members.    The   Limited  Members  received   distributions   of
$2,279,298  and  $2,519,455  and the  Managing  Members  received
distributions of $67,786 and $74,506 for the years, respectively.
In  September  and  December 2007, the Company  declared  special
distributions  of  $107,071  and  $108,071,  respectively,  which
resulted   in   higher  distributions  in  2007  and   a   higher
distribution payable at December 31, 2007.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

       During 2008 and 2007, the Company distributed $131,313 and
$165,657 of net sale proceeds to the Limited and Managing Members
as  part  of  their quarterly distributions, which represented  a
return of capital of $3.09 and $3.88 per LLC Unit, respectively.

        The  Company may acquire Units from Limited  Members  who
have  tendered  their Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
acquired  at  a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated  to
purchase  in any year more than 2% of the total number  of  Units
outstanding  on  January 1 of such year.  In no event  shall  the
Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion
of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or
operation of the Company.

        During  2008, three Limited Members redeemed a  total  of
190.71  Units  for  $136,054  in accordance  with  the  Operating
Agreement.  During 2007, four Limited Members redeemed a total of
95.87  Units for $70,719.  The Company acquired these Units using
Net  Cash  Flow  from  operations.  In prior years,  one  Limited
Member  redeemed  a  total  of  128.9  Units  for  $98,907.   The
redemptions  increase  the remaining Limited  Member's  ownership
interest  in  the  Company.   As a  result  of  these  redemption
payments  and  pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the  Managing
Members  received distributions of $4,207 and $2,187 in 2008  and
2007, respectively.

       The continuing rent payments from the properties, together
with  cash  generated from property sales, should be adequate  to
fund  continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations
on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Economy and Market Conditions

       The impact of conditions in the current economy, including
the  turmoil  in the credit markets, has adversely affected  many
real   estate  companies.   However,  the  absence  of   mortgage
financing  on  the Company's properties eliminates the  risks  of
foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively  impact  the
value  and  distributions  of leveraged  real  estate  companies.
Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely  affect
the operations of the Company's tenants and their cash flows.  If
a  tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the Company's
income  would decrease, its distributions would likely be reduced
and the value of its properties might decline.

        Historically, the Company has sold properties at  a  gain
and  distributed  the  gain  proceeds  as  part  of  its  regular
quarterly  distributions,  and to make special  distributions  on
occasion.   The  remaining  sales  proceeds  were  reinvested  in
additional properties.  Beginning in the fourth quarter of  2008,
general  economic conditions caused the volume of property  sales
to  slow dramatically for all real estate sellers.  In 2009,  the
Company  will likely complete fewer property sales, if any,  than
it  has  in  the  past.   Until property sales  occur,  quarterly
distributions going forward will reflect the distribution of  net
core  rental  income and capital reserves, if  any.  Distribution
rates   are  expected  to  be  variable  and  less  than   recent
distribution  rates until such time as economic conditions  allow
the   Company  to,  once  again,  begin  selling  properties   at
acceptable prices and generating gains for distribution.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Members:
AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC
St. Paul, Minnesota



     We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of AEI Income
& Growth Fund 25 LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related statements of income,
cash  flows  and  changes in members' equity for the  years  then
ended.   The  Company's  management  is  responsible  for   these
financial  statements.   Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the  Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (United  States).
Those  standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit  to
obtain   reasonable   assurance  about  whether   the   financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  The company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal  control over financial reporting.  Our  audit  included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting  as  a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in  the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an  opinion
on  the  effectiveness  of the company's  internal  control  over
financial  reporting.  Accordingly, we express no  such  opinion.
An  audit  also  includes examining, on a  test  basis,  evidence
supporting   the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial
statements,   assessing  the  accounting  principles   used   and
significant  estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating
the  overall  financial statement presentation.  We believe  that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present  fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of  AEI  Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC as of December 31, 2008  and
2007,  and  the results of its operations and its cash flows  for
the  years  then ended, in conformity with accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007

(1)  Organization -

     AEI  Income  &  Growth  Fund 25 LLC ("Company"),  a  Limited
     Liability  Company, was formed on June 24, 2002  to  acquire
     and  lease commercial properties to operating tenants.   The
     Company's operations are managed by AEI Fund Management XXI,
     Inc.  ("AFM"), the Managing Member.  Robert P. Johnson,  the
     President  and sole director of AFM, serves as  the  Special
     Managing  Member.  AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary  of  AEI
     Capital  Corporation of which Mr. Johnson  is  the  majority
     shareholder.    AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.   ("AEI"),   an
     affiliate  of AFM, performs the administrative and operating
     functions for the Company.

     The terms of the offering called for a subscription price of
     $1,000  per  LLC Unit, payable on acceptance of  the  offer.
     The  Company commenced operations on September 11, 2003 when
     minimum  subscriptions of 1,500 LLC Units ($1,500,000)  were
     accepted.   The offering terminated May 12, 2005,  when  the
     extended  offering  period expired.   The  Company  received
     subscriptions for 42,434.763 Units.  Under the terms of  the
     Operating  Agreement,  the  Limited  Members  and   Managing
     Members   contributed  funds  of  $42,434,763  and   $1,000,
     respectively.  The Company shall continue until December 31,
     2053,  unless dissolved, terminated and liquidated prior  to
     that date.

     During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which  the
     Managing Members determine to distribute will be distributed
     97%  to  the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members.
     Distributions to Limited Members will be made  pro  rata  by
     Units.

     Any  Net  Proceeds  of Sale, as defined, from  the  sale  or
     financing of properties which the Managing Members determine
     to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves,
     be  paid  in  the following manner: (i) first,  99%  to  the
     Limited  Members  and 1% to the Managing Members  until  the
     Limited  Members  receive  an amount  equal  to:  (a)  their
     Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 7%
     of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative
     but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed
     from  Net  Cash  Flow; (ii) any remaining  balance  will  be
     distributed  90%  to  the Limited Members  and  10%  to  the
     Managing Members.  Distributions to the Limited Members will
     be made pro rata by Units.

     For  tax  purposes,  profits  from  operations,  other  than
     profits  attributable  to  the  sale,  exchange,  financing,
     refinancing  or  other  disposition  of  property,  will  be
     allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the  Managing
     Members.   Net losses from operations will be allocated  99%
     to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007

(1)  Organization - (Continued)

     For  tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing,
     or  other  disposition  of property  will  be  allocated  in
     accordance  with  the Operating Agreement  as  follows:  (i)
     first,  to  those  Members with deficit  balances  in  their
     capital  accounts  in an amount equal to  the  sum  of  such
     deficit  balances; (ii) second, 99% to the  Limited  Members
     and  1%  to the Managing Members until the aggregate balance
     in  the Limited Members' capital accounts equals the sum  of
     the Limited Members' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus  an
     amount  equal  to 7% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions
     per  annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not
     previously  allocated;  (iii)  third,  the  balance  of  any
     remaining  gain  will then be allocated 90% to  the  Limited
     Members  and  10% to the Managing Members.  Losses  will  be
     allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the  Managing
     Members.

     The  Managing Members are not required to currently  fund  a
     deficit capital balance.  Upon liquidation of the Company or
     withdrawal  by a Managing Member, the Managing Members  will
     contribute to the Company an amount equal to the  lesser  of
     the  deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01%  of
     the  total capital contributions of the Limited Members over
     the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -

     Financial Statement Presentation

       The  accounts of the Company are maintained on the accrual
       basis  of  accounting for both federal income tax purposes
       and financial reporting purposes.

     Accounting Estimates

       Management  uses  estimates and assumptions  in  preparing
       these  financial statements in accordance  with  generally
       accepted  accounting  principles.   Those  estimates   and
       assumptions may affect the reported amounts of assets  and
       liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
       liabilities,  and  the  reported  revenues  and  expenses.
       Actual results could differ from those estimates.

       The  Company regularly assesses whether market events  and
       conditions  indicate  that it is  reasonably  possible  to
       recover  the carrying amounts of its investments  in  real
       estate  from  future operations and sales.   A  change  in
       those  market events and conditions could have a  material
       effect on the carrying amount of its real estate.

     Cash Concentrations of Credit Risk

       The   Company's   cash  is  deposited  in  two   financial
       institutions  and at times during the year it  may  exceed
       FDIC insurance limits.

                 AEI INCOME & GROWTH FUND 25 LLC
                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

     Receivables

       Credit  terms are extended to tenants in the normal course
       of   business.    The  Company  performs  ongoing   credit
       evaluations  of  its customers' financial  condition  and,
       generally, requires no collateral.

       Receivables   are   recorded  at   their   estimated   net
       realizable  value.   The  Company  follows  a  policy   of
       providing  an  allowance for doubtful  accounts;  however,
       based on historical experience, and its evaluation of  the
       current  status  of  receivables, the Company  is  of  the
       belief  that  such  accounts will be  collectible  in  all
       material  respects and thus an allowance is not necessary.
       Accounts  are considered past due if payment is  not  made
       on  a timely basis in accordance with the Company's credit
       terms.   Receivables considered uncollectible are  written
       off.

     Income Taxes

       The  income or loss of the Company for federal income  tax
       reporting  purposes  is  includable  in  the  income   tax
       returns  of  the Members.  In general, no recognition  has
       been  given to income taxes in the accompanying  financial
       statements.

       The  tax  return  and the amount of distributable  Company
       income  or loss are subject to examination by federal  and
       state  taxing authorities.  If such an examination results
       in  changes to distributable Company income or  loss,  the
       taxable   income   of  the  members  would   be   adjusted
       accordingly.

     Real Estate

       The  Company's  real estate is leased  under  net  leases,
       classified  as operating leases.  The leases  provide  for
       base   annual   rental   payments   payable   in   monthly
       installments.   The  Company  recognizes  rental   revenue
       according  to  the  terms of the individual  leases.   For
       leases   that   contain  stated  rental   increases,   the
       increases  are  recognized in the year in which  they  are
       effective.   Contingent  rental  payments  are  recognized
       when  the  contingencies on which the payments  are  based
       are  satisfied  and the rental payments become  due  under
       the terms of the leases.

       The  Company  purchases properties  and  records  them  at
       cost.   The  Company compares the carrying amount  of  its
       properties  to  the estimated probability-weighted  future
       cash  flows expected to result from the property  and  its
       eventual  disposition.  If the sum of the expected  future
       cash  flows  is  less  than the  carrying  amount  of  the
       property,  the  Company recognizes an impairment  loss  by
       the  amount  by which the carrying amount of the  property
       exceeds the fair value of the property.

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

       The  Company has capitalized as Investments in Real Estate
       certain  costs  incurred in the review and acquisition  of
       the  properties.  The costs were allocated  to  the  land,
       buildings and equipment.

       The   buildings   and  equipment  of   the   Company   are
       depreciated  using the straight-line method for  financial
       reporting purposes based on estimated useful lives  of  25
       years and 5 years, respectively.

       In  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
       Standards  No.  144,  Accounting  for  the  Impairment  or
       Disposal  of Long-Lived Assets, upon complete disposal  of
       a  property or classification of a property as Real Estate
       Held  for Sale, the Company includes the operating results
       and  sale of the property in discontinued operations.   In
       addition,  the  Company reclassifies  the  prior  periods'
       operating   results  of  the  property   to   discontinued
       operations.

       The  Company  accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-
       common  with  affiliated entities and/or  unrelated  third
       parties  using  the  proportionate  consolidation  method.
       Each  tenant-in-common owns a separate, undivided interest
       in  the properties.  Any tenant-in-common that holds  more
       than  a  50% interest does not control decisions over  the
       other    tenant-in-common   interests.    The    financial
       statements  reflect only this Company's  percentage  share
       of   the   properties'  land,  building   and   equipment,
       liabilities, revenues and expenses.

       The  Company's  properties  are subject  to  environmental
       laws  and  regulations  adopted  by  various  governmental
       entities  in the jurisdiction in which the properties  are
       located.    These  laws  could  require  the  Company   to
       investigate  and remediate the effects of the  release  or
       disposal  of  hazardous materials at  these  locations  if
       found.  For each property, an environmental assessment  is
       completed  prior to acquisition.  In addition,  the  lease
       agreements  typically  strictly prohibit  the  production,
       handling, or storage of hazardous materials (except  where
       incidental  to  the  tenant's  business  such  as  use  of
       cleaning  supplies)  in violation  of  applicable  law  to
       restrict  environmental and other  damage.   Environmental
       liabilities  are  recorded  when  it  is  determined   the
       liability  is  probable and the costs  can  reasonably  be
       estimated.   There were no environmental issues  noted  or
       liabilities recorded at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

     Fair Value Measurements

       Statement  of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157  "Fair
       Value  Measurements"  ("SFAS  157")  defines  fair  value,
       outlines  a  framework for measuring fair  value,  details
       the  required  disclosures and was  effective  January  1,
       2008.   SFAS  157's requirements for certain  nonfinancial
       assets  and  liabilities recognized or disclosed  at  fair
       value  on  a nonrecurring basis are deferred until  fiscal
       years beginning after November 15, 2008.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

       Under  SFAS  157, fair value is defined as the price  that
       would  be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer  a
       liability   in  an  orderly  transaction  between   market
       participants  at the measurement date in the principal  or
       most   advantageous  market.   SFAS  157   establishes   a
       hierarchy  in determining the fair value of  an  asset  or
       liability.  The fair value hierarchy has three  levels  of
       inputs,   both  observable  and  unobservable.  SFAS   157
       requires  the utilization of the lowest possible level  of
       input  to  determine fair value.  Level 1  inputs  include
       quoted  market  prices in an active market  for  identical
       assets  or  liabilities.  Level 2 inputs are market  data,
       other  than  Level 1, that are observable either  directly
       or  indirectly.   Level  2 inputs  include  quoted  market
       prices  for  similar assets or liabilities, quoted  market
       prices   in  an  inactive  market,  and  other  observable
       information  that  can  be corroborated  by  market  data.
       Level  3  inputs  are  unobservable  and  corroborated  by
       little  or  no market data.  The Company has no assets  or
       liabilities  measured at fair value on a  recurring  basis
       that  would  require disclosure under this  pronouncement.
       When  testing for recoverability of properties under  SFAS
       No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
       Lived  Assets, the provisions of this statement  are  used
       when comparing fair value to carrying value.

     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

       In  December  2007,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards
       Board  issued Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards
       No.  141  (revised  2007), "Business Combinations"  ("SFAS
       141(R)"),  which  establishes principles and  requirements
       for  how  an acquirer shall recognize and measure  in  its
       financial  statements  the identifiable  assets  acquired,
       the  liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling  interest  in
       the  acquiree,  and any goodwill acquired  in  a  business
       combination.  Additionally, SFAS 141(R) requires  that  an
       acquirer  must  immediately expense all acquisition  costs
       and  fees  associated  with  an acquisition.  SFAS  141(R)
       became  effective  on  January 1,  2009.   We  expect  the
       adoption  of SFAS 141(R) to have an impact on our  results
       of  operations  to the extent properties are  acquired  in
       2009  and  future years.  Acquisition expenses, which  are
       currently capitalized as Investments in Real Estate,  will
       instead   be  expensed  immediately  as  incurred.    Post
       acquisition,  there will be a subsequent  positive  impact
       on  operations through a reduction in depreciation expense
       over the estimated life of the properties.

     Reclassification

       Certain  items related to discontinued operations  in  the
       prior    period's   financial   statements    have    been
       reclassified  to  conform  to  2008  presentation.   These
       reclassifications had no effect on Members'  capital,  net
       income or cash flows.

     On  December 17, 2007, the Company purchased a 38%  interest
     in   a  parcel  of  land  in  Fredericksburg,  Virginia  for
     $1,935,063.  The Company obtained title to the land  in  the
     form of an undivided fee simple interest in the 38% interest
     purchased.  Simultaneous with the purchase of the land,  the
     Company  entered into a Project Construction and Development
     Financing  Agreement under which the Company advanced  funds
     to  Silver-Honaker Development Company, LLC  ("Silver")  for
     the  construction of a Dick's Sporting Goods  store  on  the
     site.   On  March 12, 2008, the Company sold an 11% interest
     in the Dick's Sporting Goods property to AEI Income & Growth
     Fund  23 LLC, an affiliate of the Company.  The sales  price
     was  equal to the amount the Company had invested in the 11%
     interest,  so  no  gain or loss was recognized.   After  the
     sale, the Company's owns a 27% interest in the land and  was
     responsible  for  27%  of  the  construction  costs  of  the
     building.   The  Company's share of  the  total  acquisition
     costs, including the cost of the land, was $3,126,601.

(4)  Investments in Real Estate - (Continued)

     The  property is leased to Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. under
     a  Lease  Agreement  with a primary term  of  10  years  and
     initial  annual rent of $219,445 for the interest purchased.
     Pursuant to the Lease, the tenant commenced paying  rent  on
     May 8, 2008.  Pursuant to the development agreement, for the
     period  from  December 17, 2007 through May 7, 2008,  Silver
     paid the Company interest at a rate of 6.75% on the purchase
     price  of the land and the amounts advanced for construction
     of  the  store.  Pursuant to the Lease, any improvements  to
     the land during the term of the Lease become the property of
     the Company.

     In  November  2007, Kona Restaurant Group, Inc.  (KRG),  the
     tenant  of  the Johnny Carino's restaurants, approached  the
     Company  with a request to adjust the rent on the properties
     to   a   market   rental  rate  based  on  the  restaurants'
     performance  and the current conditions in the  market.   In
     March 2008, after reviewing the financial statements for the
     restaurants and KRG, the Company agreed to amend the  Leases
     to  reduce the current annual rent for the properties by 26%
     to  $217,395.  This amount is scheduled to increase annually
     by  1.5%. In addition, the amendments provide for additional
     rental  payments  if the restaurants' sales  exceed  certain
     stated  amounts.   In August 2008, the Partnership  received
     certification from Fired Up, Inc., the parent company of KRG
     and  guarantor  of the Leases, that it had achieved  certain
     expense  and  debt  reduction  measures  required   by   the
     amendments.   As  a  result,  the  amendments  will   remain
     effective for the remainder of the lease terms.

     For  properties owned as of December 31, 2008,  the  minimum
     future rent payments required by the leases are as follows:

                       2009           $ 2,679,953

(6)  Discontinued Operations -

     On September 26, 2006, Tia's Florida, LLC, the tenant of the
     Tia's  Tex-Mex  restaurant  in Brandon,  Florida  filed  for
     Chapter  7  bankruptcy,  which  leads  to  liquidation   and
     dissolution   of  the  company.   The  tenant   closed   the
     restaurant.   The  primary guarantor of the  Lease,  Julio's
     Investors  LLC  (Julio's), continued to  pay  the  rent  and
     property  expenses.   In the second  quarter  of  2007,  the
     Company  and  Julio's entered into an agreement whereby  the
     Company  would release Julio's from its Lease  guarantee  in
     exchange  for a lump sum payment of $227,010.  This  payment
     was contingent on completion of the sale of the property and
     was received on July 30, 2007.

     On  June  22,  2007,  the  Company sold  the  Tia's  Tex-Mex
     restaurant in Brandon, Florida to an unrelated third  party.
     The  Company received net sale proceeds of $2,163,779, which
     resulted in a net gain of $31,931.  At the time of sale, the
     cost and related accumulated depreciation was $2,261,506 and
     $129,658, respectively.

     During  the third quarter of 2007, the Company sold its  25%
     interest  in  the  Jared  Jewelry store  in  Goodlettsville,
     Tennessee, in four separate transactions, to unrelated third
     parties.   The Company received total net sale  proceeds  of
     $1,251,065,  which resulted in a net gain of $328,152.   The
     cost  and  related accumulated depreciation of the interests
     sold was $988,254 and $65,341, respectively.

(7)  Members' Capital - (Continued)

     The  Company may acquire Units from Limited Members who have
     tendered  their  Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
     acquired  at a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated
     to  purchase in any year more than 2% of the total number of
     Units  outstanding on January 1 of such year.  In  no  event
     shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in  the
     sole discretion of the Managing Members, such purchase would
     impair the capital or operation of the Company.

     During  2008,  three  Limited Members redeemed  a  total  of
     190.71  Units for $136,054 in accordance with the  Operating
     Agreement.   During  2007, four Limited Members  redeemed  a
     total  of  95.87  Units for $70,719.  The  Company  acquired
     these  Units  using  Net  Cash Flow  from  operations.   The
     redemptions   increase   the  remaining   Limited   Member's
     ownership  interest in the Company.  As a  result  of  these
     redemption payments and pursuant to the Operating Agreement,
     the  Managing Members received distributions of  $4,207  and
     $2,187 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

     After  the  effect  of  redemptions,  the  Adjusted  Capital
     Contribution,  as  defined in the  Operating  Agreement,  is
     $1,009.89 per original $1,000 invested.

ITEM 9AT.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

       (a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

        Under  the  supervision  and with  the  participation  of
management, including its President and Chief Financial  Officer,
the Managing Member of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of
the   design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure  controls   and
procedures  (as  defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under  the  Securities
Exchange  Act  of  1934 (the "Exchange Act")).  Based  upon  that
evaluation,  the  President and Chief Financial  Officer  of  the
Managing  Member  concluded that, as of the  end  of  the  period
covered  by  this report, our disclosure controls and  procedures
were  effective  in  ensuring  that information  required  to  be
disclosed  by us in the reports that we file or submit under  the
Exchange  Act  is  recorded, processed, summarized  and  reported
within  the time periods specified in applicable rules and  forms
and  that  such  information is accumulated and  communicated  to
management,  including the President and Chief Financial  Officer
of  the Managing Member, in a manner that allows timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

       (b)  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

       (i) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.   The  Managing  Member, through  its  management,  is
responsible  for  establishing and maintaining adequate  internal
control  over  our financial reporting, as defined in  Rule  13a-
15(f) under the Exchange Act, and for performing an assessment of
the   effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over   financial
reporting  as  of  December  31,  2008.   Internal  control  over
financial  reporting is a process designed to provide  reasonable
assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting  and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes  in
accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles.   Our
system  of  internal  control over financial  reporting  includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of  records  that,  in reasonable detail, accurately  and  fairly
reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of  the
Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are
recorded   as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of   financial
statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being  made  only in accordance with authorizations of management
of  the  Managing Member; and (iii) provide reasonable  assurance
regarding   prevention  or  timely  detection   of   unauthorized
acquisition,  use,  or disposition of the Company's  assets  that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

        Management of the Managing Member performed an assessment
of  the  effectiveness  of our internal  control  over  financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008 based upon criteria in Internal
Control-Integrated   Framework  issued  by   the   Committee   of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway  Commission  ("COSO").
Based  on  our  assessment, management  of  the  Managing  Member
determined that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective  as  of  December 31, 2008 based  on  the  criteria  in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

ITEM 9AT.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  (Continued)

        This annual report does not include an attestation report
of  our  registered  public accounting  firm  regarding  internal
control  over financial reporting.  Management's report  was  not
subject  to attestation by our registered public accounting  firm
pursuant  to  temporary  rules  of the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission that permit us to provide only management's report  in
this annual report.

         (ii)    Changes  in  Internal  Control  Over   Financial
Reporting.  During the most recent period covered by this report,
there  has  been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange  Act)
that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely   to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION.

       None.


                            PART III

ITEM 10.  DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

        The registrant is a limited liability company and has  no
officers,  directors, or direct employees.  The Managing  Members
manage  and  control  the  Company's  affairs  and  have  general
responsibility  and  the  ultimate  authority  in   all   matters
affecting the Company's business.  The Managing Members  are  AEI
Fund  Management XXI, Inc. (AFM), the Managing Member, and Robert
P.  Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, President and sole director
of  AFM,  the  Special Managing Member.  AFM is  a  wholly  owned
subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson is the
majority   shareholder.   AFM  has  only  one  senior   financial
executive,  its  Chief Financial Officer.   The  Chief  Financial
Officer  reports  directly to Mr. Johnson and is accountable  for
his actions to Mr. Johnson.  Although Mr. Johnson and AFM require
that  all  of  their  personnel, including  the  Chief  Financial
Officer, engage in honest and ethical conduct, ensure full, fair,
accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure, comply with  all
applicable  governmental laws, rules and regulations, and  report
to  Mr. Johnson any deviation from these principles, because  the
organization  is  composed of only approximately 35  individuals,
because  the  management  of a company  by  an  entity  that  has
different  interests in distributions and income  than  investors
involves numerous conflicts of interest that must be resolved  on
a  daily  basis, and because the ultimate decision maker  in  all
instances  is Mr. Johnson, AFM has not adopted a formal  code  of
conduct.   Instead,  the materials pursuant  to  which  investors
purchase Units disclose these conflicts of interest in detail and
Mr.  Johnson,  as  the  CEO and sole director  of  AFM,  resolves
conflicts  to  the  best  of  his ability,  consistent  with  his
fiduciary obligations to AFM and the fiduciary obligations of AFM
to the Company.  The director and officers of AFM are as follows:

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.
         (Continued)

        Robert  P.  Johnson, age 64, is Chief Executive  Officer,
President  and  sole director and has held these positions  since
the  formation  of AFM in August 1994, and has  been  elected  to
continue  in these positions until December 2009.  From  1970  to
the  present, he has been employed exclusively in the  investment
industry,  specializing in limited partnership  investments.   In
that capacity, he has been involved in the development, analysis,
marketing   and  management  of  public  and  private  investment
programs investing in net lease properties as well as public  and
private  investment  programs investing  in  energy  development.
Since 1971, Mr. Johnson has been the president, a director and  a
registered principal of AEI Securities, Inc., which is registered
with  the SEC as a securities broker-dealer, is a member  of  the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and is  a  member
of  the  Security Investors Protection Corporation  (SIPC).   Mr.
Johnson   has  been  president,  a  director  and  the  principal
shareholder   of  AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.,  a  real   estate
management  company founded by him, since 1978.  Mr.  Johnson  is
currently  a general partner or principal of the general  partner
in ten limited partnerships and a managing member in five LLCs.

        Patrick  W.  Keene,  age 49, is Chief Financial  Officer,
Treasurer  and  Secretary  and has  held  these  positions  since
January  22,  2003  and  has been elected to  continue  in  these
positions  until December 2009.  Mr. Keene has been  employed  by
AEI  Fund  Management, Inc. and affiliated entities  since  1986.
Prior  to being elected to the positions above, he was Controller
of  the various entities.  From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Keene was  with
KPMG  Peat  Marwick  Certified Public Accountants,  first  as  an
auditor and later as a tax manager.  Mr. Keene is responsible for
all accounting functions of AFM and the registrant.

       Since Mr. Johnson serves as the Special Managing Member of
the  Company,  as well as the sole director of AFM,  all  of  the
duties  that might be assigned to an audit committee are assigned
to  Mr. Johnson.  Mr. Johnson is not an audit committee financial
expert, as defined.  As an officer and majority owner, through  a
parent  company, of AFM, and as the Special Managing Member,  Mr.
Johnson is not a "disinterested director" and may be subject to a
number of conflicts of interests in his capacity as sole director
of AFM.

        Before the independent auditors are engaged, Mr. Johnson,
as the sole director of AFM, approves all audit-related fees, and
all permissible nonaudit fees, for services of our auditors.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

        Under federal securities laws, the directors and officers
of  the Managing Member of the Company, and any beneficial  owner
of  more than 10% of a class of equity securities of the Company,
are  required  to report their ownership of the Company's  equity
securities  and  any changes in such ownership to the  Securities
and  Exchange Commission (the "Commission").  Specific due  dates
for  these  reports have been established by the Commission,  and
the Company is required to disclose in this Annual Report on 10-K
any  delinquent  filing of such reports and any failure  to  file
such  reports  during the fiscal year ended  December  31,  2008.
Based upon information provided by officers and directors of  the
Managing Member, all officers, directors and 10% owners filed all
reports on a timely basis in the 2008 fiscal year.


ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

        The Managing Member and affiliates are reimbursed at cost
for  all  services performed on behalf of the registrant and  for
all  third party expenses paid on behalf of the registrant.   The
cost for services performed on behalf of the registrant is actual
time  spent  performing such services plus  an  overhead  burden.
These  services include organizing the registrant  and  arranging
for  the  offer  and  sale  of Units,  reviewing  properties  for
acquisition and rendering administrative, property management and
property  sales services.  The amount and nature of such payments
are detailed in Item 13 of this annual report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
       MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

        The following table sets forth information pertaining  to
the ownership of the Units by each person known by the Company to
beneficially  own  5%  or  more of the Units,  by  each  Managing
Member, and by each officer or director of the Managing Member as
of February 28, 2009:

   Address for all:
   1300 Wells Fargo Place
   30 East 7th Street, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101

The  Managing Members know of no holders of more than 5%  of  the
outstanding Units.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
         DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

        The  registrant,  AFM  and  its  affiliates  have  common
management and utilize the same facilities.  As a result, certain
administrative  expenses  are  allocated  among   these   related
entities.   All  of  such activities and any  other  transactions
involving the affiliates of the Managing Member of the registrant
are  governed  by,  and  are conducted in  conformity  with,  the
limitations  set  forth  in  the  Operating  Agreement   of   the
registrant.   Reference  is  made to  Note  3  of  the  Financial
Statements,   as  presented,  and  is  incorporated   herein   by
reference,  for  details of related party  transactions  for  the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

        Neither  the registrant, nor the Managing Member  of  the
registrant,  has a board of directors consisting of  any  members
who are "independent."  The sole director of the Managing Member,
Robert  P.  Johnson, is also the Special Managing Member  of  the
registrant,  and is the Chief Executive Officer,  and  indirectly
the  principal owner, of the Managing Member.  Accordingly, there
is  no  disinterested  board,  or other  functioning  body,  that
reviews  related party transactions, or the transactions  between
the  registrant and the Managing Members, except as performed  in
connection with the audit of its financial statements.

(ii)  1% of gross revenues, plus an initial leasing fee of 3%  of

each lease, (iii) 3% of Net Proceeds of Sale, and (iv) 10% of Net
Cash  Flow  less  the Net Cash Flow actually distributed  to  the
Managing Members. The cumulative reimbursements subject  to  this
limitation  are reimbursements for (i) organization and  offering
expenses, including commissions, (ii) acquisition expenses, (iii)
