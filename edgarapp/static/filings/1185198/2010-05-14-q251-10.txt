(1)  The  condensed  statements included herein have been  prepared
     by  the  registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules  and
     regulations  of  the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  and
     reflect   all  adjustments  which  are,  in  the  opinion   of

     operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent  with
     the  annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these
     condensed   statements  consist  only  of   normal   recurring
     adjustments.   Certain information, accounting  policies,  and
     footnote    disclosures   normally   included   in   financial
     statements  prepared  in  accordance with  generally  accepted
     accounting principles have been condensed or omitted  pursuant
     to   such  rules  and  regulations,  although  the  registrant
     believes  that  the  disclosures  are  adequate  to  make  the
     information  presented not misleading.  It is  suggested  that
     these  condensed financial statements be read  in  conjunction
     with  the  financial statements and the summary of significant
     accounting  policies  and  notes  thereto  included   in   the
     registrant's latest annual report on Form 10-K.

     accepted.   The offering terminated May 12, 2005,  when  the
     extended  offering  period expired.   The  Company  received
     subscriptions for 42,434.763 Units.  Under the terms of  the
     Operating  Agreement,  the  Limited  Members  and   Managing
     Members   contributed  funds  of  $42,434,763  and   $1,000,
     respectively.  The Company shall continue until December 31,
     2053,  unless dissolved, terminated and liquidated prior  to
     that date.

     During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which  the
     Managing Members determine to distribute will be distributed
     97%  to  the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members.
     Distributions to Limited Members will be made  pro  rata  by
     Units.

(2)  Organization - (Continued)

     Any  Net  Proceeds  of Sale, as defined, from  the  sale  or
     financing of properties which the Managing Members determine
     to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves,
     be  paid  in  the following manner: (i) first,  99%  to  the
     Limited  Members  and 1% to the Managing Members  until  the
     Limited  Members  receive  an amount  equal  to:  (a)  their
     Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 7%
     of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative
     but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed
     from  Net  Cash  Flow; (ii) any remaining  balance  will  be
     distributed  90%  to  the Limited Members  and  10%  to  the
     Managing Members.  Distributions to the Limited Members will
     be made pro rata by Units.

     For  tax  purposes,  profits  from  operations,  other  than
     profits  attributable  to  the  sale,  exchange,  financing,
     refinancing  or  other  disposition  of  property,  will  be
     allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the  Managing
     Members.   Net losses from operations will be allocated  99%
     to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.

     For  tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing,
     or  other  disposition  of property  will  be  allocated  in
     accordance  with  the Operating Agreement  as  follows:  (i)
     first,  to  those  Members with deficit  balances  in  their
     capital  accounts  in an amount equal to  the  sum  of  such
     deficit  balances; (ii) second, 99% to the  Limited  Members
     and  1%  to the Managing Members until the aggregate balance
     in  the Limited Members' capital accounts equals the sum  of
     the Limited Members' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus  an
     amount  equal  to 7% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions
     per  annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not
     previously  allocated;  (iii)  third,  the  balance  of  any
     remaining  gain  will then be allocated 90% to  the  Limited
     Members  and  10% to the Managing Members.  Losses  will  be
     allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the  Managing
     Members.

     The  Managing Members are not required to currently  fund  a
     deficit capital balance.  Upon liquidation of the Company or
     withdrawal  by a Managing Member, the Managing Members  will
     contribute to the Company an amount equal to the  lesser  of
     the  deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01%  of
     the  total capital contributions of the Limited Members over
     the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(3)  Reclassification -

     Certain  items  related to discontinued  operations  in  the
     prior  period's financial statements have been  reclassified
     to  conform  to  2010 presentation.  These reclassifications
     had no effect on Members' capital, net income or cash flows.

(4)  Payable to AEI Fund Management, Inc. -

     AEI  Fund  Management, Inc. performs the administrative  and
     operating  functions for the Company.  The  payable  to  AEI
     Fund   Management  represents  the  balance  due  for  those
     services.    This  balance  is  non-interest   bearing   and
     unsecured  and  is  to  be  paid in  the  normal  course  of
     business.

(5)  Discontinued Operations -

     During  the  second and third quarter of 2009,  the  Company
     sold  15.329%  of  the Applebee's restaurant  in  Macedonia,
     Ohio,  in  two  separate transactions,  to  unrelated  third
     parties.   The Company received total net sale  proceeds  of
     $555,272,  which  resulted in a net gain of  $114,685.   The
     cost  and  related accumulated depreciation of the interests
     sold was $480,533 and $39,946, respectively.

     On February 25, 2010, the Company sold an additional 5.9641%
     of  the  Applebee's  restaurant in Macedonia,  Ohio,  to  an
     unrelated  third  party.   The  Company  received  net  sale
     proceeds  of  $199,600, which resulted  in  a  net  gain  of
     $28,180.   The cost and related accumulated depreciation  of
     the  interests  sold was $186,962 and $15,542, respectively.
     The  Company  is  attempting to sell its remaining  73.6791%
     interest  in  the property.  At March 31, 2010 and  December
     31,  2009,  the property was classified as Real Estate  Held
     for Sale with a carrying value of $2,117,695 and $2,289,115,
     respectively.

     During   the  first  three  months  of  2009,  the   Company
     distributed $50,505 of net sale proceeds to the Limited  and
     Managing  Members as part of their quarterly  distributions,
     which represented a return of capital of $1.19 per LLC Unit.
     The Company anticipates the remaining net sale proceeds will
     either  be  reinvested in additional property or distributed
     to the Members in the future.

     The  financial  results for this property are  reflected  as
     Discontinued   Operations  in  the  accompanying   financial
     statements.   The following are the results of  discontinued
     operations for the three months ended March 31:

(6)  Fair Value Measurements

     As  of  March  31,  2010,  the  Company  has  no  assets  or
     liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring  basis  or
     nonrecurring basis.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        This  section contains "forward-looking statements" which
represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning  future
events, including statements regarding anticipated application of
cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the
sufficiency  of  cash  to  meet  operating  expenses,  rates   of
distribution,  and  other  matters.  These,  and  other  forward-
looking  statements,  should be evaluated in  the  context  of  a
number  of  factors  that  may  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition and results of operations, including the following:

    Market  and  economic conditions which affect the  value
    of  the  properties the Company owns and the cash  from
    rental income such properties generate;

    the  federal  income tax consequences of rental  income,
    deductions,  gain  on  sales and other  items  and  the
    effects of these consequences for Members;

    resolution  by  the Managing Members of  conflicts  with
    which they may be confronted;

    the   success  of  the  Managing  Members  of   locating
    properties with favorable risk return characteristics;

    the effect of tenant defaults; and

    the  condition of the industries in which the  tenants  of
    properties owned by the Company operate.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

        The  preparation  of  the Company's financial  statements
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that  may
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and
expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets   and
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on  an  ongoing
basis,  including  those related to the carrying  value  of  real
estate  and  the  allocation  by AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.  of
expenses to the Company as opposed to other funds they manage.

       Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company purchased properties
and  recorded them in the financial statements at cost (including
capitalized acquisition expenses).  For acquisitions completed on
or  after January 1, 2009, acquisition-related transaction  costs
will  be expensed as incurred as a result of the Company adopting
new  guidance on business combinations that expands the scope  of
acquisition accounting. The Company tests long-lived  assets  for
recoverability  when events or changes in circumstances  indicate
that  the  carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties
the  Company will hold and operate, management determines whether
impairment  has occurred by comparing the property's probability-
weighted  future undiscounted cash flows to its current  carrying
value.   For  properties  held  for sale,  management  determines
whether  impairment  has  occurred by  comparing  the  property's
estimated  fair  value less cost to sell to its current  carrying
value.   If  the  carrying value is greater than  the  realizable
value,  an  impairment loss is recorded to  reduce  the  carrying
value  of the property to its realizable value.  Changes in these
assumptions  or  analysis  may  cause  material  changes  in  the
carrying value of the properties.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        AEI  Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each  of
the  funds  they manage primarily on the basis of the  number  of
hours  devoted  by their employees to each fund's affairs.   They
also  allocate  expenses at the end of each month  that  are  not
directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number  of
investors  in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative  to
other  funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these  expenses
subject  to  detailed  limitations  contained  in  the  Operating
Agreement.

        Management  of the Company has discussed the  development
and   selection  of  the  above  accounting  estimates  and   the
management  discussion  and analysis disclosures  regarding  them
with the managing member of the Company.

Results of Operations

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009,  the
Company  recognized rental income from continuing  operations  of
$616,676  and  $611,178, respectively.  In  2010,  rental  income
increased due to rent increases on four properties.

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009,  the
Company  incurred  LLC  administration expenses  from  affiliated
parties   of   $86,237   and   $89,743,   respectively.     These
administration  expenses  include  costs  associated   with   the
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting
requirements and communicating with the Limited Members.   During
the  same  periods,  the Company incurred LLC administration  and
property  management expenses from unrelated parties  of  $10,384
and  $14,441,  respectively.   These  expenses  represent  direct
payments  to  third  parties for legal and  filing  fees,  direct
administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes,  insurance  and
other property costs.

        For  the  three  months ended March 31,  2010  and  2009,
depreciation  expense  was $228,263 and  $205,266,  respectively.
The  increase  was  due to the Company reclassifying  the  Sports
Authority  store in Wichita, Kansas from held-for-sale status  to
held-for-use status during the fourth quarter of 2009.

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009,  the
Company   recognized  interest  income  of  $3,126  and   $1,628,
respectively.   In  2010 interest income  increased  due  to  the
Company having more money invested in a money market account  due
to property sales.

        Upon complete disposal of a property or classification of
a property as Real Estate Held for Sale, the Company includes the
operating  results  and  sale  of the  property  in  discontinued
operations.   In  addition, the Company  reclassifies  the  prior
periods'  operating  results  of  the  property  to  discontinued
operations.   For  the  three months ended March  31,  2010,  the
Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $77,273
representing rental income less property management  expenses  of
$49,093 and gain on disposal of real estate of $28,180.  For  the
three  months ended March 31, 2009, the Company recognized income
from  discontinued  operations  of  $60,768  representing  rental
income less property management expenses.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        During  the second and third quarter of 2009, the Company
sold 15.329% of the Applebee's restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio,  in
two  separate  transactions,  to unrelated  third  parties.   The
Company  received  total  net sale proceeds  of  $555,272,  which
resulted  in  a  net  gain of $114,685.   The  cost  and  related
accumulated  depreciation of the interests sold was $480,533  and
$39,946, respectively.

        On  February  25,  2010, the Company sold  an  additional
5.9641%  of the Applebee's restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio,  to  an
unrelated third party.  The Company received net sale proceeds of
$199,600, which resulted in a net gain of $28,180.  The cost  and
related  accumulated  depreciation  of  the  interests  sold  was
$186,962 and $15,542, respectively.  The Company is attempting to
sell  its remaining 73.6791% interest in the property.  At  March
31,  2010  and December 31, 2009, the property was classified  as
Real Estate Held for Sale with a carrying value of $2,117,695 and
$2,289,115, respectively.

         Management  believes  inflation  has  not  significantly
affected  income  from  operations.   Leases  may  contain   rent
increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over
a  specified period, which will result in an increase  in  rental
income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the
real  estate  to  appreciate in value.   However,  inflation  and
changing  prices  may  have an adverse impact  on  the  operating
margins  of  the  properties' tenants, which could  impair  their
ability  to  pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net  Cash  Flow
available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2010,  the
Company's  cash balances increased $180,366 as a result  of  cash
generated  from the sale of property, which was partially  offset
by  distributions paid to the Members in excess of cash generated
from  operating activities.  During the three months ended  March
31,  2009,  the Company's cash balances increased  $28,596  as  a
result  of cash generated from operating activities in excess  of
distributions paid to the Members.

        Net  cash provided by operating activities decreased from
$573,748 in 2009 to $525,716 in 2010 as a result of a decrease in
total   rental  and  interest  income  in  2010  and  net  timing
differences  in the collection of payments from the  tenants  and
the  payment  of  expenses,  which were  partially  offset  by  a
decrease  in LLC administration and property management  expenses
in 2010.

        The  major  components of the Company's  cash  flow  from
investing activities are investments in real estate and  proceeds
from  the  sale  of real estate.  During the three  months  ended
March 31, 2010, the Company generated cash flow from the sale  of
real estate of $199,600.

        The  Company's  primary  use of  cash  flow,  other  than
investment   in  real  estate,  is  distribution  and  redemption
payments  to Members.  The Company declares its regular quarterly
distributions  before  the  end of  each  quarter  and  pays  the
distribution  in  the first week after the end of  each  quarter.
The  Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from
quarter  to  quarter.  Redemption payments are paid to  redeeming
Members on a semi-annual basis.
ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009,  the
Company   declared  distributions  of  $544,950   and   $544,110,
respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions
of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3%
to  the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of  Sale
were  allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing
Members.   The Limited Members received distributions of $528,601
and  $528,797 and the Managing Members received distributions  of
$16,349 and $15,313 for the periods, respectively.

        During  the  first  three months  of  2009,  the  Company
distributed  $50,505  of net sale proceeds  to  the  Limited  and
Managing Members as part of their quarterly distributions,  which
represented  a  return of capital of $1.19  per  LLC  Unit.   The
Company  anticipates the remaining net sale proceeds will  either
be  reinvested  in  additional property  or  distributed  to  the
Members in the future.

        The  Company may acquire Units from Limited  Members  who
have  tendered  their Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
acquired  at  a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated  to
purchase  in any year more than 2% of the total number  of  Units
outstanding  on  January 1 of such year.  In no event  shall  the
Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion
of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or
operation of the Company.  During 2009 and the first three months
of  2010,  the Company did not redeem any Units from the  Limited
Members.   In prior years, 8 Limited Members redeemed a total  of
415.48   Units  for  $305,680.   The  redemptions  increase   the
remaining Limited Member's ownership interest in the Company.

       The continuing rent payments from the properties, together
with  cash  generated from property sales, should be adequate  to
fund  continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations
on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Economy and Market Conditions

       The impact of conditions in the current economy, including
the  turmoil  in the credit markets, has adversely affected  many
real  estate investment funds.  However, the absence of  mortgage
financing  on  the Company's properties eliminates the  risks  of
foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively  impact  the
value  and  distributions  of leveraged  real  estate  investment
funds.  Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely
affect  the  operations of the Company's tenants and  their  cash
flows.  If a tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the
Company's  income would decrease, its distributions would  likely
be reduced and the value of its properties might decline.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

       Not required for a smaller reporting company.

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

       (a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

        Under  the  supervision  and with  the  participation  of

the Managing Member of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of
the   design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure  controls   and

disclosed  by us in the reports that we file or submit under  the
Exchange  Act  is  recorded, processed, summarized  and  reported
within  the time periods specified in applicable rules and  forms
and  that  such  information is accumulated and  communicated  to
management,  including the President and Chief Financial  Officer
of  the Managing Member, in a manner that allows timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

       (b)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

        (i) During the most recent period covered by this report,
there  has  been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange  Act)
that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely   to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

business  day  of January or July of each year, as determined  by
the  Managing  Member in accordance with the  provisions  of  the
Operating  Agreement.   Units  tendered  to  the  Company  during

respectively, of each year subject to the following  limitations.
The  Company will not be obligated to purchase in any  year  more
