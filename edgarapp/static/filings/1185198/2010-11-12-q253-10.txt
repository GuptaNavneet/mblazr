(1)  The  condensed  statements included herein have been  prepared
     by  the  registrant, without audit, pursuant to the rules  and
     regulations  of  the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  and
     reflect   all  adjustments  which  are,  in  the  opinion   of
     management,  necessary to a fair statement of the  results  of
     operations for the interim period, on a basis consistent  with
     the  annual audited statements.  The adjustments made to these
     condensed   statements  consist  only  of   normal   recurring
     adjustments.   Certain information, accounting  policies,  and
     footnote    disclosures   normally   included   in   financial
     statements  prepared  in  accordance with  generally  accepted
     accounting principles have been condensed or omitted  pursuant
     to   such  rules  and  regulations,  although  the  registrant
     believes  that  the  disclosures  are  adequate  to  make  the
     information  presented not misleading.  It is  suggested  that
     these  condensed financial statements be read  in  conjunction
     with  the  financial statements and the summary of significant
     accounting  policies  and  notes  thereto  included   in   the
     registrant's latest annual report on Form 10-K.

     For  tax  purposes,  profits  from  operations,  other  than
     profits  attributable  to  the  sale,  exchange,  financing,
     refinancing  or  other  disposition  of  property,  will  be
     allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the  Managing
     Members.   Net losses from operations will be allocated  99%
     to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.

     For  tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing,
     or  other  disposition  of property  will  be  allocated  in
     accordance  with  the Operating Agreement  as  follows:  (i)
     first,  to  those  Members with deficit  balances  in  their

     the  deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01%  of
     the  total capital contributions of the Limited Members over
     the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(3)  Reclassification -

     AEI  Fund  Management, Inc. performs the administrative  and
     operating  functions for the Company.  The  payable  to  AEI
     Fund   Management  represents  the  balance  due  for  those
     services.    This  balance  is  non-interest   bearing   and
     unsecured  and  is  to  be  paid in  the  normal  course  of
     business.

(6)  Discontinued Operations -

     During  the  second and third quarter of 2009,  the  Company
     sold  15.329%  of  the Applebee's restaurant  in  Macedonia,
     Ohio,  in  two  separate transactions,  to  unrelated  third
     parties.   The Company received total net sale  proceeds  of
     $555,272,  which  resulted in a net gain of  $114,685.   The
     cost  and  related accumulated depreciation of the interests
     sold was $480,533 and $39,946, respectively.

     During  the first nine months of 2010, the Company  sold  an
     additional   18.7894%  of  the  Applebee's   restaurant   in
     Macedonia,   Ohio,   in  three  separate  transactions,   to
     unrelated  third  parties.  The Company received  total  net
     sale  proceeds of $630,957, which resulted in a net gain  of
     $90,911.   The cost and related accumulated depreciation  of
     the  interests  sold was $589,009 and $48,963, respectively.
     The  Company  is  attempting to sell its remaining  60.8538%
     interest  in  the  property.   At  September  30,  2010  and
     December  31,  2009,  the property was  classified  as  Real
     Estate Held for Sale with a carrying value of $1,749,069 and
     $2,289,115, respectively.

     During   the   first  nine  months  of  2009,  the   Company
     distributed $50,505 of net sale proceeds to the Limited  and
     Managing  Members as part of their quarterly  distributions,
     which represented a return of capital of $1.19 per LLC Unit.
     The Company anticipates the remaining net sale proceeds will
     either  be  reinvested in additional property or distributed
     to the Members in the future.

     The financial results for these properties are reflected  as
     Discontinued   Operations  in  the  accompanying   financial
     statements.   The following are the results of  discontinued
     operations for the periods ended September 30:

(7)  Fair Value Measurements -

     As  of  September  30, 2010, the Company has  no  assets  or
     liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring  basis  or
     nonrecurring basis.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        This  section contains "forward-looking statements" which
represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning  future
events, including statements regarding anticipated application of
cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the
sufficiency  of  cash  to  meet  operating  expenses,  rates   of
distribution,  and  other  matters.  These,  and  other  forward-
looking  statements,  should be evaluated in  the  context  of  a
number  of  factors  that  may  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition and results of operations, including the following:

      Market  and  economic conditions which affect the  value
      of  the  properties the Company owns and the cash  from
      rental income such properties generate;

      the  federal  income tax consequences of rental  income,
      deductions,  gain  on  sales and other  items  and  the
      effects of these consequences for Members;

      resolution  by  the Managing Members of  conflicts  with
      which they may be confronted;

      the   success  of  the  Managing  Members  of   locating
      properties with favorable risk return characteristics;

      the effect of tenant defaults; and

      the condition of the industries in which the  tenants  of
      properties owned by the Company operate.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

        The  preparation  of  the Company's financial  statements
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that  may
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and
expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets   and
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on  an  ongoing
basis,  including  those related to the carrying  value  of  real
estate  and  the  allocation  by AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.  of
expenses to the Company as opposed to other funds they manage.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

       Prior to January 1, 2009, the Company purchased properties
and  recorded them in the financial statements at cost (including
capitalized acquisition expenses).  For acquisitions completed on
or  after January 1, 2009, acquisition-related transaction  costs
will  be expensed as incurred as a result of the Company adopting
new  guidance on business combinations that expands the scope  of
acquisition accounting. The Company tests long-lived  assets  for
recoverability  when events or changes in circumstances  indicate
that  the  carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties
the  Company will hold and operate, management determines whether
impairment  has occurred by comparing the property's probability-
weighted  future undiscounted cash flows to its current  carrying
value.   For  properties  held  for sale,  management  determines
whether  impairment  has  occurred by  comparing  the  property's
estimated  fair  value less cost to sell to its current  carrying
value.   If  the  carrying value is greater than  the  realizable
value,  an  impairment loss is recorded to  reduce  the  carrying
value  of the property to its realizable value.  Changes in these
assumptions  or  analysis  may  cause  material  changes  in  the
carrying value of the properties.

        AEI  Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each  of
the  funds  they manage primarily on the basis of the  number  of
hours  devoted  by their employees to each fund's affairs.   They
also  allocate  expenses at the end of each month  that  are  not
directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number  of
investors  in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative  to
other  funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these  expenses
subject  to  detailed  limitations  contained  in  the  Operating
Agreement.

        Management  of the Company has discussed the  development
and   selection  of  the  above  accounting  estimates  and   the
management  discussion  and analysis disclosures  regarding  them
with the managing member of the Company.

Results of Operations

       For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, the
Company  recognized rental income from continuing  operations  of
$1,869,575 and $1,829,820, respectively.  In 2010, rental  income
increased mainly due to rent increases on five properties.

       For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, the
Company  incurred  LLC  administration expenses  from  affiliated
parties   of   $270,522   and  $255,348,   respectively.    These
administration  expenses  include  costs  associated   with   the
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting
requirements and communicating with the Limited Members.   During
the  same  periods,  the Company incurred LLC administration  and
property  management expenses from unrelated parties  of  $41,976
and  $110,438,  respectively.  These  expenses  represent  direct
payments  to  third  parties for legal and  filing  fees,  direct
administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes,  insurance  and
other  property costs.  The decrease in these expenses  in  2010,
when  compared to 2009, was mainly due to a one-time  charge  for
additional state income taxes paid in 2009.

        For  the  nine months ended September 30, 2010 and  2009,
depreciation  expense  was $678,919 and  $615,798,  respectively.
The  increase  was  due to the Company reclassifying  the  Sports
Authority  store in Wichita, Kansas from held-for-sale status  to
held-for-use status during the fourth quarter of 2009.


ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

       For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, the
Company   recognized  interest  income  of  $10,916  and  $5,636,
respectively.   In  2010 interest income  increased  due  to  the
Company having more money invested in a money market account  due
to property sales.

        Upon complete disposal of a property or classification of
a property as Real Estate Held for Sale, the Company includes the
operating  results  and  sale  of the  property  in  discontinued
operations.   In  addition, the Company  reclassifies  the  prior
periods'  operating  results  of  the  property  to  discontinued
operations.   For the nine months ended September 30,  2010,  the
Company   recognized  income  from  discontinued  operations   of
$225,758  representing  rental income  less  property  management
expenses  of  $134,847 and gain on disposal  of  real  estate  of
$90,911.   For  the  nine months ended September  30,  2009,  the
Company   recognized  income  from  discontinued  operations   of
$288,556  representing  rental income  less  property  management
expenses  of  $173,871 and gain on disposal  of  real  estate  of
$114,685.

        During  the second and third quarter of 2009, the Company
sold 15.329% of the Applebee's restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio,  in
two  separate  transactions,  to unrelated  third  parties.   The
Company  received  total  net sale proceeds  of  $555,272,  which
resulted  in  a  net  gain of $114,685.   The  cost  and  related
accumulated  depreciation of the interests sold was $480,533  and
$39,946, respectively.

        During the first nine months of 2010, the Company sold an
additional  18.7894% of the Applebee's restaurant  in  Macedonia,
Ohio, in three separate transactions, to unrelated third parties.
The  Company received total net sale proceeds of $630,957,  which
resulted  in  a  net  gain  of $90,911.   The  cost  and  related
accumulated  depreciation of the interests sold was $589,009  and
$48,963,  respectively.  The Company is attempting  to  sell  its
remaining  60.8538% interest in the property.  At  September  30,
2010  and December 31, 2009, the property was classified as  Real
Estate  Held  for  Sale with a carrying value of  $1,749,069  and
$2,289,115, respectively.

         Management  believes  inflation  has  not  significantly
affected  income  from  operations.   Leases  may  contain   rent
increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over
a  specified period, which will result in an increase  in  rental
income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the
real  estate  to  appreciate in value.   However,  inflation  and
changing  prices  may  have an adverse impact  on  the  operating
margins  of  the  properties' tenants, which could  impair  their
ability  to  pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net  Cash  Flow
available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During  the  nine months ended September  30,  2010,  the
Company's  cash balances increased $573,112 as a result  of  cash
generated  from the sale of property, which was partially  offset
by  distributions and redemption payments paid to the Members  in
excess  of cash generated from operating activities.  During  the
nine months ended September 30, 2009, the Company's cash balances
increased $543,577 as a result of cash generated from the sale of
property, which was partially offset by distributions paid to the
Members in excess of cash generated from operating activities.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        Net  cash provided by operating activities decreased from
$1,622,517  in  2009 to $1,607,625 in 2010 as  a  result  of  net
timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants
and  the payment of expenses, which were partially offset  by  an
increase  in  total  rental and interest income  in  2010  and  a
decrease  in LLC administration and property management  expenses
in 2010.

        The  major  components of the Company's  cash  flow  from
investing activities are investments in real estate and  proceeds
from  the  sale  of  real estate.  During the nine  months  ended
September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Company generated cash flow from
the  sale  of real estate of $630,957 and $555,272, respectively.
Subsequent  to  September 30, 2010, the Partnership  purchased  a
property as it reinvested cash generated from property sales.

        On October 20, 2010, the Company purchased a 21% interest
in a Scott & White Clinic in College Station, Texas for $771,868.
The  property is leased to Scott & White Healthcare under a Lease
Agreement with a remaining primary term of 9.7 years and  initial
annual rent of $64,680 for the interest purchased.  The remaining
interests in the property were purchased by AEI Net Lease  Income
& Growth Fund XX Limited Partnership and AEI Income & Growth Fund
XXI Limited Partnership, affiliates of the Company.

        The  Company's  primary  use of  cash  flow,  other  than
investment   in  real  estate,  is  distribution  and  redemption
payments  to Members.  The Company declares its regular quarterly
distributions  before  the  end of  each  quarter  and  pays  the
distribution  in  the first week after the end of  each  quarter.
The  Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from
quarter  to  quarter.  Redemption payments are paid to  redeeming
Members on a semi-annual basis.

       For the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, the
Company  declared  distributions of  $1,634,849  and  $1,634,009,
respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions
of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3%
to  the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of  Sale
were  allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing
Members.    The   Limited  Members  received   distributions   of
$1,585,803  and  $1,585,999  and the  Managing  Members  received
distributions   of   $49,046  and  $48,010   for   the   periods,
respectively.

        During  the  first  nine  months  of  2009,  the  Company
distributed  $50,505  of net sale proceeds  to  the  Limited  and
Managing Members as part of their quarterly distributions,  which
represented  a  return of capital of $1.19  per  LLC  Unit.   The
Company  anticipates the remaining net sale proceeds will  either
be  reinvested  in  additional property  or  distributed  to  the
Members in the future.

        The  Company may acquire Units from Limited  Members  who
have  tendered  their Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
acquired  at  a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated  to
purchase  in any year more than 2% of the total number  of  Units
outstanding  on  January 1 of such year.  In no event  shall  the
Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion
of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or
operation of the Company.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        On April 1, 2010, two Limited Members redeemed a total of
46.92   Units  for  $29,702  in  accordance  with  the  Operating
Agreement.  The Company acquired these Units using Net Cash  Flow
from  operations.  During 2009, the Company did  not  redeem  any
Units  from  the Limited Members.  In prior years, eight  Limited
Members  redeemed  a  total of 415.48 Units  for  $305,680.   The
redemptions  increase  the remaining Limited  Member's  ownership
interest  in  the  Company.   As a  result  of  these  redemption
payments  and  pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the  Managing
Members received distributions of $918 in 2010.

       The continuing rent payments from the properties, together
with  cash  generated from property sales, should be adequate  to
fund  continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations
on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Economy and Market Conditions

       The impact of conditions in the current economy, including
the  turmoil  in the credit markets, has adversely affected  many
real  estate investment funds.  However, the absence of  mortgage
financing  on  the Company's properties eliminates the  risks  of
foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively  impact  the
value  and  distributions  of leveraged  real  estate  investment
funds.  Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely
affect  the  operations of the Company's tenants and  their  cash
flows.  If a tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the
Company's  income would decrease, its distributions would  likely
be reduced and the value of its properties might decline.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

       Not required for a smaller reporting company.

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

       (a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

        Under  the  supervision  and with  the  participation  of
management, including its President and Chief Financial  Officer,
the Managing Member of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of
the   design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure  controls   and
procedures  (as  defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under  the  Securities
Exchange  Act  of  1934 (the "Exchange Act")).  Based  upon  that
evaluation,  the  President and Chief Financial  Officer  of  the
Managing  Member  concluded that, as of the  end  of  the  period
covered  by  this report, our disclosure controls and  procedures
were  effective  in  ensuring  that information  required  to  be
disclosed  by us in the reports that we file or submit under  the
Exchange  Act  is  recorded, processed, summarized  and  reported
within  the time periods specified in applicable rules and  forms
and  that  such  information is accumulated and  communicated  to
management,  including the President and Chief Financial  Officer
of  the Managing Member, in a manner that allows timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

       (b)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

        (i) During the most recent period covered by this report,
there  has  been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange  Act)
that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely   to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
