                             PART I

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

        AEI  Income  & Growth Fund 25 LLC (the "Company"  or  the
"Registrant") is a limited liability company which was  organized
pursuant  to the laws of the State of Delaware on June 24,  2002.
The  registrant  is  comprised of AEI Fund Management  XXI,  Inc.
("AFM"), as the Managing Member, Robert P. Johnson, the President
and  sole  director of AFM, as the Special Managing  Member,  and
purchasers of LLC Units as Limited Members.  The Company  offered
for  sale up to $50,000,000 of limited membership interests  (the
"Units")  (50,000  Units  at  $1,000  per  Unit)  pursuant  to  a
registration  statement  effective May  13,  2003.   The  Company
commenced   operations  on  September  11,  2003   when   minimum
subscriptions of 1,500 LLC Units ($1,500,000) were accepted.  The
offering  terminated  May  12, 2005 when  the  extended  offering
period   expired.    The  Company  received   subscriptions   for
42,434.763   LLC  Units.   Under  the  terms  of  the   Operating
Agreement,  the Limited Members and Managing Members  contributed
funds of $42,434,763 and $1,000, respectively.

        The  Company was organized to acquire existing and  newly
constructed  commercial properties, to lease such  properties  to
tenants  under  net  leases,  to  hold  such  properties  and  to
eventually sell such properties.  From subscription proceeds, the
Company purchased fifteen properties, including partial interests
in eight properties, at a total cost of $36,389,018.  The balance
of  the  subscription  proceeds was applied to  organization  and
syndication costs.  The properties are commercial, single  tenant
buildings leased under net leases.

        The  Company's  properties  were  purchased  without  any
indebtedness.   The  Company will not finance properties  in  the
future to obtain proceeds for new property acquisitions.   If  it
is   required  to  do  so,  the  Company  may  incur   short-term
indebtedness   to  finance  day-to-day  cash  flow   requirements
(including cash flow necessary to repurchase Units).  The Company
may borrow to finance the refurbishing of a property.

        The  Company will hold its properties until the  Managing
Members  determine  that  the sale or other  disposition  of  the
properties  is  advantageous in view of the Company's  investment
objectives.  In deciding whether to sell properties, the Managing
Members will consider factors such as potential appreciation, net
cash flow and income tax considerations.  The Company expects  to
sell some or all of its properties prior to its final liquidation
and  to  reinvest  the  proceeds from such  sales  in  additional
properties.  The Company reserves the right, at the discretion of
the Managing Members, to either distribute proceeds from the sale
of  properties  to  the Members or to reinvest such  proceeds  in
additional  properties,  provided that  sufficient  proceeds  are
distributed  to  the  Limited Members to pay  federal  and  state
income  taxes related to any taxable gain recognized as a  result
of  the  sale.  It is anticipated that the Company will  commence
liquidation through the sale of its remaining properties eight to
twelve years after completion of the acquisition phase, depending
upon the then current real estate and money markets, the economic
climate and the income tax consequences to the Members.

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.  (Continued)

Leases

       Although there are variations in the specific terms of the
leases,  the following is a summary of the general terms  of  the
Company's  leases.  The properties are leased to various  tenants
under  net leases, classified as operating leases.  Under  a  net
lease,   the  tenant  is  responsible  for  real  estate   taxes,
insurance,  maintenance, repairs and operating expenses  for  the
property.   For  some  leases,  the Company  is  responsible  for
repairs  to the structural components of the building, the  roof,
and  the  parking lot.  At the time the properties were acquired,
the  remaining primary lease terms varied from 10  to  20  years.
The leases provide the tenants with two to four five-year renewal
options  subject to the same terms and conditions as the  primary
term.   The  leases  provide  for base  annual  rental  payments,
payable  in monthly installments, and contain rent clauses  which
entitle  the  Company to receive additional rent in future  years
based on stated rent increases.

Property Activity During the Last Three Years

        As  of December 31, 2007, the Company owned interests  in
fourteen  properties with a total original cost  of  $35,090,210.
During  the  years ended December 31, 2008, 2009  and  2010,  the
Company  sold partial interests in one property and received  net
sale   proceeds  of  $191,947,  $555,272  and  $1,571,988,  which
resulted  in  net  gains  of  $47,438,  $114,685,  and  $218,688,
respectively.   During  2007  and  2008,  the  Company   expended
$4,050,434  to purchase one additional property as it  reinvested
cash  generated  from  property sales.  On March  12,  2008,  the
Company  sold a partial interest in this property at its cost  to
an  affiliated fund for $923,833.  After the sale, the  Company's
investment  in  this property was $3,126,601.  During  2010,  the
Company expended $771,868 to purchase one additional property  as
it   reinvested  cash  generated  from  property  sales.   As  of
December  31,  2010,  the  Company  owned  interests  in  fifteen
properties with a total original cost of $34,886,661.

Major Tenants

        During 2010, four tenants each contributed more than  ten
percent of the Company's total rental revenue.  The major tenants
in aggregate contributed 71% of total rental revenue in 2010.  It
is  anticipated  that, based on minimum rental payments  required
under  the  leases, each major tenant will continue to contribute
more than ten percent of rental revenue in 2011 and future years.
Any  failure of these major tenants could materially  affect  the
Company's net income and cash distributions.

Competition

        The  Company  is  a minor factor in the  commercial  real
estate  business.   There are numerous entities  engaged  in  the
commercial  real  estate  business which have  greater  financial
resources  than the Company.  At the time the Company  elects  to
dispose  of its properties, it will be in competition with  other
persons and entities to find buyers for its properties.

Employees

        The Company has no direct employees.  Management services
are  performed for the Company by AEI Fund Management,  Inc.,  an
affiliate of AFM.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.


Investment Objectives

         The  Company's  investment  objectives  are  to  acquire
existing  or  newly-developed commercial properties that  provide
(i)  regular  rental income; (ii) growth in lease income  through
rent   escalation  provisions;  (iii)  capital   growth   through
appreciation  in the value of properties; (iv) reduced  occupancy
risks as a result of long-term leases with creditworthy corporate
tenants;  and (v) passive income that may be offset  by  eligible
passive  losses  from other investments for  tax  purposes.   The
Company does not have a policy, and there is no limitation, as to
the  amount or percentage of assets that may be invested  in  any
one  property.   However,  to the extent possible,  the  Managing
Members  attempt  to  diversify the  type  and  location  of  the
properties.

Description of Properties

        The  Company's properties are commercial,  single  tenant
buildings.  The properties were acquired on a debt-free basis and
are  leased  to  various tenants under net leases, classified  as
operating  leases.   The Company holds an  undivided  fee  simple
interest in the properties.

        The  Company's  properties are  subject  to  the  general
competitive conditions incident to the ownership of single tenant
investment  real estate.  Since each property is leased  under  a
long-term  lease, there is little competition until  the  Company
decides to sell the property.  At this time, the Company will  be
competing  with other real estate owners, on both a national  and
local level, in attempting to find buyers for the properties.  In
the  event  of  a tenant default, the Company would be  competing
with  other  real estate owners, who have property vacancies,  to
attract  a  new  tenant  to  lease the property.   The  Company's
tenants  operate in industries that are very competitive and  can
be  affected  by  factors such as changes in  regional  or  local
economies, seasonality and changes in consumer preference.

        The  following table is a summary of the properties  that
the Company acquired and owned as of December 31, 2010.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.  (Continued)

        The  properties  listed above with  a  partial  ownership
percentage  are  owned  with the following  affiliated  entities:
Johnny  Carino's  restaurant  in  Lake  Charles,  Louisiana  (AEI
Private  Net  Lease  Millennium Fund Limited Partnership);  Jared
Jewelry  store in Madison Heights, Michigan (AEI Income &  Growth
Fund  23  LLC  and  AEI  Accredited Investor  Fund  2002  Limited
Partnership); Jared Jewelry store in Auburn Hills, Michigan  (AEI
Income  &  Growth  Fund  XXI  Limited Partnership);  CarMax  auto
superstore (AEI Income & Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership, AEI
Income  & Growth Fund 24 LLC and AEI Private Net Lease Millennium
Fund  Limited Partnership); Sports Authority store (AEI Income  &
Growth  Fund  26 LLC); Advance Auto Parts store in  Indianapolis,
Indiana  (AEI  Income  &  Growth Fund XXII Limited  Partnership);
Dick's Sporting Goods store (AEI Income & Growth Fund 23 LLC, AEI
Income & Growth Fund 24 LLC and AEI Income & Growth Fund 26 LLC);
and  Scott & White Clinic (AEI Net Lease Income & Growth Fund  XX
Limited  Partnership  and AEI Income & Growth  Fund  XXI  Limited
Partnership).    The   remaining  interest  in   the   Applebee's
restaurant is owned by unrelated third parties.

        The  Company accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-
common  with  affiliated entities and/or unrelated third  parties
using  the  proportionate consolidation method.  Each  tenant-in-
common  owns  a  separate, undivided interest in the  properties.
Any tenant-in-common that holds more than a 50% interest does not
control decisions over the other tenant-in-common interests.  The
financial statements reflect only this Company's percentage share
of  the  properties'  land, building and equipment,  liabilities,
revenues and expenses.

        At  the  time the properties were acquired, the remaining
primary  lease  terms  varied from 10 to 20  years.   The  leases
provide  the  tenants with two to four five-year renewal  options
subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary term.

       Pursuant to the lease agreements, the tenants are required
to provide proof of adequate insurance coverage on the properties
they  occupy.   The Managing Members believe the  properties  are
adequately covered by insurance and consider the properties to be
well-maintained and sufficient for the Company's operations.

       For tax purposes, the Company's properties are depreciated
under the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS).  The
largest depreciable component of a property is the building which
is  depreciated, using the straight-line method, over  39  years.
The  remaining depreciable components of a property are  personal
property  and land improvements which are depreciated,  using  an
accelerated method, over 5 and 15 years, respectively.  Since the
Company  has  tax-exempt Members, the Company is subject  to  the
rules  of  Section 168(h)(6) of the Internal Revenue  Code  which
requires  a  percentage of the properties' depreciable components
to  be  depreciated  over  longer lives using  the  straight-line
method.  In general, the federal tax basis of the properties  for
tax  depreciation  purposes is the same as  the  basis  for  book
depreciation  purposes,  except for  properties  purchased  after
January 1, 2009.  For those properties, acquisition expenses that
were expensed for book purposes were capitalized and added to the
basis of the property for tax depreciation purposes.

        At  December 31, 2010, all properties listed  above  were
100% occupied.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK-
        HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

        (a) As of December 31, 2010, there were 1,141 holders  of
record of the registrant's LLC Units.  There is no other class of
security  outstanding or authorized.  The registrant's Units  are
not  a  traded security in any market.  During the period covered
by  this  report, the Company did not sell any equity  securities
that are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

       Cash distributions of $66,462 and $64,359 were made to the
Managing Members and $2,220,103 and $2,114,600 were made  to  the
Limited   Members   for   2010  and  2009,   respectively.    The
distributions  were made on a quarterly basis and  represent  Net
Cash   Flow,  as  defined,  except  as  discussed  below.   These
distributions  should  not be compared  with  dividends  paid  on
capital stock by corporations.

        As  part  of the Limited Members' distributions discussed
above, the Company distributed net sale proceeds of $105,700  and
$50,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

       (b) Not applicable.

        (c)  Pursuant to Section 7.7 of the Operating  Agreement,
each Limited Member has the right to present Units to the Company
for  purchase by submitting notice to the Managing Member  during
January or July of each year.  The purchase price of the Units is
equal  to  80% of the net asset value per Unit, as of  the  first
business  day  of January or July of each year, as determined  by
the  Managing  Member in accordance with the  provisions  of  the
Operating  Agreement.   Units  tendered  to  the  Company  during
January  and  July  are redeemed on April 1st  and  October  1st,
respectively, of each year subject to the following  limitations.
The  Company will not be obligated to purchase in any  year  more
than 2% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1  of
such  year.   In  no  event  shall the Company  be  obligated  to
purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member,
such  purchase  would  impair the capital  or  operation  of  the
Company.   During the last three months of 2010, the Company  did
not purchase any Units.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCK-
        HOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Other Information

        The Company is required, pursuant to FINRA Rule 2810,  to
disclose  in each annual report distributed to Limited Members  a
per  Unit  estimated value, the method by which it was  developed
and the date of the data used to develop the estimated value.  At
December 31, 2010, the Company's Units were valued at $814.  This
value  was the aggregate estimated value of the Company's  assets
less  the  Company's liabilities, and less the value attributable
to the interest of the Managing Members, divided by the number of
Units   outstanding.    The  Company's  cash,   receivables   and
liabilities  were  valued at face value.  Each of  the  Company's
properties were valued by dividing their annual rental income  as
of  December 1, 2010 by a capitalization rate the Managing Member
believed  to be representative of the retail market for the  sale
of  each  property.  The resulting value for  each  property  was
reviewed  to determine that it also reflected circumstances  that
may  have  been unique to each specific property.  No independent
property  appraisals were obtained.  The valuations performed  by
the  Managing  Member were estimates only, and were  based  on  a
number of assumptions which may not be accurate or complete.   In
addition, property values are subject to change and could decline
after  the  date of the valuations.  Accordingly, this  estimated
value,  prepared by the Managing Member, should not be viewed  as
the  amount  at which a Limited Member may be able  to  sell  his
units,  or  the fair market value of the Company properties,  nor
does  it  represent  the amount of net proceeds  Limited  Members
would  receive  if  the  Company properties  were  sold  and  the
proceeds distributed in a liquidation of the Company.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        This  section contains "forward-looking statements" which
represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning  future
events, including statements regarding anticipated application of
cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the
sufficiency  of  cash  to  meet  operating  expenses,  rates   of
distribution,  and  other  matters.  These,  and  other  forward-
looking  statements,  should be evaluated in  the  context  of  a
number  of  factors  that  may  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition and results of operations, including the following:

     Market  and  economic conditions which affect the  value
     of  the  properties the Company owns and the cash  from
     rental income such properties generate;

     the  federal  income tax consequences of rental  income,
     deductions,  gain  on  sales and other  items  and  the
     effects of these consequences for Members;

     resolution  by  the Managing Members of  conflicts  with
     which they may be confronted;

     the   success  of  the  Managing  Members  of   locating
     properties with favorable risk return characteristics;

     the effect of tenant defaults; and

     the  condition of the industries in which the  tenants  of
     properties owned by the Company operate.


Application of Critical Accounting Policies

        The  preparation  of  the Company's financial  statements
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that  may
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and
expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets   and
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on  an  ongoing
basis,   including  those  related  to  the  carrying  value   of
investments  in  real  estate  and the  allocation  by  AEI  Fund
Management, Inc. of expenses to the Company as opposed  to  other
funds they manage.

        The Company purchases properties and records them in  the
financial   statements   at  cost  (not   including   acquisition
expenses).     The   Company   tests   long-lived   assets    for
recoverability  when events or changes in circumstances  indicate
that  the  carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties
the  Company will hold and operate, management determines whether
impairment  has occurred by comparing the property's probability-
weighted  future undiscounted cash flows to its current  carrying
value.   For  properties  held  for sale,  management  determines
whether  impairment  has  occurred by  comparing  the  property's
estimated  fair  value less cost to sell to its current  carrying
value.   If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable
value,  an  impairment loss is recorded to  reduce  the  carrying
value  of  the property to its net realizable value.  Changes  in
these  assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in  the
carrying value of the properties.

        AEI  Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each  of
the  funds  they manage primarily on the basis of the  number  of
hours  devoted  by their employees to each fund's affairs.   They
also  allocate  expenses at the end of each month  that  are  not
directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number  of
investors  in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative  to
other  funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these  expenses
subject  to  detailed  limitations  contained  in  the  Operating
Agreement.


ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        Management  of the Company has discussed the  development
and   selection  of  the  above  accounting  estimates  and   the
management  discussion  and analysis disclosures  regarding  them
with the managing member of the Company.

Results of Operations

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2010  and  2009,  the
Company  recognized rental income from continuing  operations  of
$2,513,177 and $2,439,142, respectively.  In 2010, rental  income
increased  mainly  due  to  additional  rent  received  from  one
property   acquisition  in  2010  and  rent  increases   on   six
properties.  Based on the scheduled rent for the properties owned
as  of February 28, 2011, the Company expects to recognize rental
income from continuing operations of approximately $2,598,000  in
2011.

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2010  and  2009,  the
Company  incurred  LLC  administration expenses  from  affiliated
parties   of   $378,628   and  $371,797,   respectively.    These
administration  expenses  include  costs  associated   with   the
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting
requirements and communicating with the Limited Members.   During
the  same  periods,  the Company incurred LLC administration  and
property  management expenses from unrelated parties  of  $48,506
and  $117,796,  respectively.  These  expenses  represent  direct
payments  to  third  parties for legal and  filing  fees,  direct
administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes,  insurance  and
other  property costs.  The decrease in these expenses  in  2010,
when  compared to 2009, was mainly due to a one-time  charge  for
additional state income taxes paid in 2009.

       For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred
property  acquisition expenses of $16,922 related to the purchase
of the Scott & White Clinic.

         For   the  years  ended  December  31,  2010  and  2009,
depreciation  expense was $907,277 and $1,005,040,  respectively.
In   2009,  depreciation  expense  was  higher  as  a  result  of
reclassifying the Sports Authority store in Wichita, Kansas  from
held-for-sale  status to held-for-use status  during  the  fourth
quarter  of  2009.  At the time of reclassification, the  Company
recognized  $183,978  of  additional  depreciation  expense  that
represented  the  amount of depreciation  that  would  have  been
recognized if the property had not been classified as Real Estate
Held for Sale.  This amount represented two years of depreciation
expense for the property.

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2010  and  2009,  the
Company   recognized  interest  income  of  $14,703  and  $8,508,
respectively.   In  2010 interest income  increased  due  to  the
Company having more money invested in a money market account  due
to property sales.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        Upon complete disposal of a property or classification of
a property as Real Estate Held for Sale, the Company includes the
operating  results  and  sale  of the  property  in  discontinued
operations.   In  addition, the Company  reclassifies  the  prior
periods'  operating  results  of  the  property  to  discontinued
operations.   For the year ended December 31, 2010,  the  Company
recognized  income  from  discontinued  operations  of   $386,892
representing rental income less property management  expenses  of
$168,204  and  gain on disposal of real estate of $218,688.   For
the  year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recognized  income
from  discontinued  operations  of $339,670  representing  rental
income less property management expenses of $224,985 and gain  on
disposal of real estate of $114,685.

        During  the second and third quarter of 2009, the Company
sold 15.329% of the Applebee's restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio,  in
two  separate  transactions,  to unrelated  third  parties.   The
Company  received  total  net sale proceeds  of  $555,272,  which
resulted  in  a  net  gain of $114,685.   The  cost  and  related
accumulated  depreciation of the interests sold was $480,533  and
$39,946, respectively.

        During  2010, the Company sold an additional 47.0843%  of
the  Applebee's  restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio, in  six  separate
transactions,  to unrelated third parties.  The Company  received
total  net sale proceeds of $1,571,988, which resulted in  a  net
gain  of $218,688.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation
of  the interests sold was $1,475,997 and $122,697, respectively.
The Company is attempting to sell its remaining 32.5589% interest
in the property.  At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the property was
classified as Real Estate Held for Sale with a carrying value  of
$935,815 and $2,289,115, respectively.

         Management  believes  inflation  has  not  significantly
affected  income  from  operations.   Leases  may  contain   rent
increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over
a  specified period, which will result in an increase  in  rental
income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the
real  estate  to  appreciate in value.   However,  inflation  and
changing  prices  may  have an adverse impact  on  the  operating
margins  of  the  properties' tenants, which could  impair  their
ability  to  pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net  Cash  Flow
available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During  the  year ended December 31, 2010, the  Company's
cash  balances  increased $799,072 as a result of cash  generated
from  the  sale of property, which was partially offset  by  cash
used  to  purchase  property,  and distributions  and  redemption
payments  paid  to the Members in excess of cash  generated  from
operating  activities.  During the year ended December 31,  2009,
the  Company's cash balances increased $601,933 as  a  result  of
cash  generated from the sale of property and cash generated from
operating  activities  in  excess of distributions  paid  to  the
Members.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        Net  cash provided by operating activities decreased from
$2,225,822  in 2009 to $2,209,370 in 2010 as a result of  $16,922
of acquisition expenses related to the purchase of real estate in
2010  and  net timing differences in the collection  of  payments
from  the  tenants  and  the  payment  of  expenses,  which  were
partially  offset  by  an increase in total rental  and  interest
income  in 2010 and a decrease in LLC administration and property
management   expenses  in  2010.   Pursuant  to  new   accounting
guidance,  the acquisition expenses were reflected  as  operating
cash  outflows.   However,  pursuant to the  Company's  Operating
Agreement,  acquisition expenses were funded with  proceeds  from
property sales.

        The  major  components of the Company's  cash  flow  from
investing activities are investments in real estate and  proceeds
from   the   sale  of  real  estate.   During  the  years   ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company generated cash flow  from
the sale of real estate of $1,571,988 and $555,272, respectively.
During  the  year  ended December 31, 2010, the Company  expended
$771,868  to invest in real properties as the Company  reinvested
cash generated from property sales.

        On October 20, 2010, the Company purchased a 21% interest
in a Scott & White Clinic in College Station, Texas for $771,868.
The  property is leased to Scott & White Healthcare under a Lease
Agreement with a remaining primary term of 9.7 years (as  of  the
date  of  purchase) and initial annual rent of  $64,680  for  the
interest purchased.  The remaining interests in the property were
purchased  by  AEI  Net  Lease Income & Growth  Fund  XX  Limited
Partnership and AEI Income & Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership,
affiliates of the Company.

        The  Company's  primary  use of  cash  flow,  other  than
investment   in  real  estate,  is  distribution  and  redemption
payments  to Members.  The Company declares its regular quarterly
distributions  before  the  end of  each  quarter  and  pays  the
distribution  in  the first week after the end of  each  quarter.
The  Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from
quarter  to  quarter.  Redemption payments are paid to  redeeming
Members on a semi-annual basis.

        For  the  years  ended December 31, 2010  and  2009,  the
Company  declared  distributions of  $2,286,565  and  $2,178,959,
respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions
of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3%
to  the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of  Sale
were  allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing
Members.    The   Limited  Members  received   distributions   of
$2,220,103  and  $2,114,600  and the  Managing  Members  received
distributions   of   $66,462  and  $64,359   for   the   periods,
respectively.  In December 2010, the Company declared  a  special
distribution of net sale proceeds of $106,768, which resulted  in
higher distributions in 2010 and a higher distribution payable at
December 31, 2010.

       During 2010 and 2009, the Company distributed $106,768 and
$50,505  of net sale proceeds to the Limited and Managing Members
as  part  of  their quarterly distributions, which represented  a
return  of capital of $2.52 and $1.19 per LLC Unit, respectively.
The  Company  anticipates the remaining net  sale  proceeds  will
either be reinvested in additional property or distributed to the
Members in the future.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        The  Company may acquire Units from Limited  Members  who
have  tendered  their Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
acquired  at  a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated  to
purchase  in any year more than 2% of the total number  of  Units
outstanding  on  January 1 of such year.  In no event  shall  the
Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion
of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or
operation of the Company.

       During 2010, two Limited Members redeemed a total of 46.92
Units  for  $29,702  in accordance with the Operating  Agreement.
The  Company  acquired  these Units  using  Net  Cash  Flow  from
operations.   During 2009, the Company did not redeem  any  Units
from  the Limited Members.  In prior years, eight Limited Members
redeemed  a  total of 415.48 Units for $305,680.  The redemptions
increase the remaining Limited Members' ownership interest in the
Company.   As a result of these redemption payments and  pursuant
to   the  Operating  Agreement,  the  Managing  Members  received
distributions of $918 in 2010.

       The continuing rent payments from the properties, together
with  cash  generated from property sales, should be adequate  to
fund  continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations
on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Economy and Market Conditions

       The impact of conditions in the current economy, including
the  turmoil  in the credit markets, has adversely affected  many
real  estate investment funds.  However, the absence of  mortgage
financing  on  the Company's properties eliminates the  risks  of
foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively  impact  the
value  and  distributions  of leveraged  real  estate  investment
funds.  Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely
affect  the  operations of the Company's tenants and  their  cash
flows.  If a tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the
Company's  income would decrease, its distributions would  likely
be reduced and the value of its properties might decline.

     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Members:
AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC
St. Paul, Minnesota



     We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of AEI Income
& Growth Fund 25 LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related statements of income,
cash  flows  and  changes in members' equity for the  years  then
ended.   The  Company's  management  is  responsible  for   these
financial  statements.   Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the  Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (United  States).
Those  standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit  to
obtain   reasonable   assurance  about  whether   the   financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal  control over financial reporting.  Our  audit  included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting  as  a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in  the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing  an  opinion
on  the  effectiveness  of the Company's  internal  control  over
financial  reporting.  Accordingly, we express no  such  opinion.
An  audit  also  includes examining, on a  test  basis,  evidence
supporting   the  amounts  and  disclosures  in   the   financial
statements,   assessing  the  accounting  principles   used   and
significant  estimates made by management, as well as  evaluating
the  overall  financial statement presentation.  We believe  that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In  our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present  fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of  AEI  Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC as of December 31, 2010  and
2009,  and  the results of its operations and its cash flows  for
the  years  then ended, in conformity with accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(1)  Organization -

     AEI  Income  &  Growth  Fund 25 LLC ("Company"),  a  Limited
     Liability  Company, was formed on June 24, 2002  to  acquire
     and  lease commercial properties to operating tenants.   The
     Company's operations are managed by AEI Fund Management XXI,
     Inc.  ("AFM"), the Managing Member.  Robert P. Johnson,  the
     President  and sole director of AFM, serves as  the  Special
     Managing  Member.  AFM is a wholly owned subsidiary  of  AEI
     Capital  Corporation of which Mr. Johnson  is  the  majority
     shareholder.    AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.   ("AEI"),   an
     affiliate  of AFM, performs the administrative and operating
     functions for the Company.

     The terms of the offering called for a subscription price of
     $1,000  per  LLC Unit, payable on acceptance of  the  offer.
     The  Company commenced operations on September 11, 2003 when
     minimum  subscriptions of 1,500 LLC Units ($1,500,000)  were
     accepted.   The offering terminated May 12, 2005,  when  the
     extended  offering  period expired.   The  Company  received
     subscriptions for 42,434.763 Units.  Under the terms of  the
     Operating  Agreement,  the  Limited  Members  and   Managing
     Members   contributed  funds  of  $42,434,763  and   $1,000,
     respectively.  The Company shall continue until December 31,
     2053,  unless dissolved, terminated and liquidated prior  to
     that date.

     During operations, any Net Cash Flow, as defined, which  the
     Managing Members determine to distribute will be distributed
     97%  to  the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members.
     Distributions to Limited Members will be made  pro  rata  by
     Units.

     Any  Net  Proceeds  of Sale, as defined, from  the  sale  or
     financing of properties which the Managing Members determine
     to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves,
     be  paid  in  the following manner: (i) first,  99%  to  the
     Limited  Members  and 1% to the Managing Members  until  the
     Limited  Members  receive  an amount  equal  to:  (a)  their
     Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 7%
     of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative
     but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed
     from  Net  Cash  Flow; (ii) any remaining  balance  will  be
     distributed  90%  to  the Limited Members  and  10%  to  the
     Managing Members.  Distributions to the Limited Members will
     be made pro rata by Units.

     For  tax  purposes,  profits  from  operations,  other  than
     profits  attributable  to  the  sale,  exchange,  financing,
     refinancing  or  other  disposition  of  property,  will  be
     allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the  Managing
     Members.   Net losses from operations will be allocated  99%
     to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(1)  Organization - (Continued)

     For  tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing,
     or  other  disposition  of property  will  be  allocated  in
     accordance  with  the Operating Agreement  as  follows:  (i)
     first,  to  those  Members with deficit  balances  in  their
     capital  accounts  in an amount equal to  the  sum  of  such
     deficit  balances; (ii) second, 99% to the  Limited  Members
     and  1%  to the Managing Members until the aggregate balance
     in  the Limited Members' capital accounts equals the sum  of
     the Limited Members' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus  an
     amount  equal  to 7% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions
     per  annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not
     previously  allocated;  (iii)  third,  the  balance  of  any
     remaining  gain  will then be allocated 90% to  the  Limited
     Members  and  10% to the Managing Members.  Losses  will  be
     allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the  Managing
     Members.

     The  Managing Members are not required to currently  fund  a
     deficit capital balance.  Upon liquidation of the Company or
     withdrawal  by a Managing Member, the Managing Members  will
     contribute to the Company an amount equal to the  lesser  of
     the  deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01%  of
     the  total capital contributions of the Limited Members over
     the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -

     Financial Statement Presentation

       The  accounts of the Company are maintained on the accrual
       basis  of  accounting for both federal income tax purposes
       and financial reporting purposes.

     Accounting Estimates

       Management  uses  estimates and assumptions  in  preparing
       these  financial statements in accordance  with  generally
       accepted  accounting  principles.   Those  estimates   and
       assumptions may affect the reported amounts of assets  and
       liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
       liabilities,  and  the  reported  revenues  and  expenses.
       Actual   results   could  differ  from  those   estimates.
       Significant   items,   subject  to  such   estimates   and
       assumptions, include the carrying value of investments  in
       real estate.

       The  Company regularly assesses whether market events  and
       conditions  indicate  that it is  reasonably  possible  to
       recover  the carrying amounts of its investments  in  real
       estate  from  future operations and sales.   A  change  in
       those  market events and conditions could have a  material
       effect on the carrying amount of its real estate.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

     Cash Concentrations of Credit Risk

       The   Company's   cash  is  deposited  in  one   financial
       institution  and at times during the year  it  may  exceed
       FDIC insurance limits.

     Receivables

       Credit  terms are extended to tenants in the normal course
       of   business.    The  Company  performs  ongoing   credit
       evaluations  of  its customers' financial  condition  and,
       generally, requires no collateral.

       Receivables   are   recorded  at   their   estimated   net
       realizable  value.   The  Company  follows  a  policy   of
       providing  an  allowance for doubtful  accounts;  however,
       based on historical experience, and its evaluation of  the
       current  status  of  receivables, the Company  is  of  the
       belief that such accounts, if any, will be collectible  in
       all  material  respects  and  thus  an  allowance  is  not
       necessary.   Accounts are considered past due  if  payment
       is  not  made  on  a timely basis in accordance  with  the
       Company's    credit    terms.    Receivables    considered
       uncollectible are written off.

     Income Taxes

       The  income or loss of the Company for federal income  tax
       reporting  purposes  is  includable  in  the  income   tax
       returns  of  the Members.  In general, no recognition  has
       been  given to income taxes in the accompanying  financial
       statements.

       The  tax  return  and the amount of distributable  Company
       income  or loss are subject to examination by federal  and
       state  taxing authorities.  If such an examination results
       in  changes to distributable Company income or  loss,  the
       taxable   income   of  the  members  would   be   adjusted
       accordingly.   Primarily  due  to  its  tax  status  as  a
       partnership,   the   Company  has   no   significant   tax
       uncertainties that require recognition or disclosure.

     Revenue Recognition

       The  Company's  real estate is leased  under  net  leases,
       classified  as operating leases.  The leases  provide  for
       base   annual   rental   payments   payable   in   monthly
       installments.   The  Company  recognizes  rental   revenue
       according  to  the  terms of the individual  leases.   For
       leases   that   contain  stated  rental   increases,   the
       increases  are  recognized in the year in which  they  are
       effective.   Contingent  rental  payments  are  recognized
       when  the  contingencies on which the payments  are  based
       are  satisfied  and the rental payments become  due  under
       the terms of the leases.

                   DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

     Investments in Real Estate

       The  Company  purchases properties  and  records  them  at
       cost.   The  Company tests real estate for  recoverability
       when events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the
       carrying  value  may not be recoverable.   For  properties
       the  Company  will  hold  and  operate,  it  compares  the
       carrying   amount  of  the  property  to   the   estimated
       probability-weighted   future  undiscounted   cash   flows
       expected  to  result from the property  and  its  eventual
       disposition.   If  the  sum of the  expected  future  cash
       flows  is  less than the carrying amount of the  property,
       the  Company recognizes an impairment loss by  the  amount
       by  which the carrying amount of the property exceeds  the
       fair  value  of  the  property.  For properties  held  for
       sale,  the  Company  determines  whether  impairment   has
       occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair  value
       less  cost to sell to its current carrying value.  If  the
       carrying  value is greater than the net realizable  value,
       an  impairment  loss  is recorded to reduce  the  carrying
       value of the property to its net realizable value.

       Prior  to  January  1,  2009, the Company  capitalized  as
       Investments in Real Estate certain costs incurred  in  the
       review and acquisition of the properties.  The costs  were
       allocated  to  the  land, buildings  and  equipment.   For
       acquisitions  completed  on  or  after  January  1,  2009,
       acquisition-related  transaction costs  were  expensed  as
       incurred  as a result of the Company adopting new guidance
       on   business  combinations  that  expands  the  scope  of
       acquisition accounting.

       The   buildings   and  equipment  of   the   Company   are
       depreciated  using the straight-line method for  financial
       reporting purposes based on estimated useful lives  of  25
       years and 5 years, respectively.

       Upon complete disposal of a property or classification  of
       a  property  as  Real Estate Held for  Sale,  the  Company
       includes  the  operating results and sale of the  property
       in  discontinued  operations.  In  addition,  the  Company
       reclassifies the prior periods' operating results  of  the
       property to discontinued operations.

       The  Company  accounts for properties owned as tenants-in-
       common  with  affiliated entities and/or  unrelated  third
       parties  using  the  proportionate  consolidation  method.
       Each  tenant-in-common owns a separate, undivided interest
       in  the properties.  Any tenant-in-common that holds  more
       than  a  50% interest does not control decisions over  the
       other    tenant-in-common   interests.    The    financial
       statements  reflect only this Company's  percentage  share
       of   the   properties'  land,  building   and   equipment,
       liabilities, revenues and expenses.

(2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

       The  Company's  properties  are subject  to  environmental
       laws  and  regulations  adopted  by  various  governmental
       entities  in the jurisdiction in which the properties  are
       located.    These  laws  could  require  the  Company   to
       investigate  and remediate the effects of the  release  or
       disposal  of  hazardous materials at  these  locations  if
       found.  For each property, an environmental assessment  is
       completed  prior to acquisition.  In addition,  the  lease
       agreements  typically  strictly prohibit  the  production,
       handling, or storage of hazardous materials (except  where
       incidental  to  the  tenant's  business  such  as  use  of
       cleaning  supplies)  in violation  of  applicable  law  to
       restrict  environmental and other  damage.   Environmental
       liabilities  are  recorded  when  it  is  determined   the
       liability  is  probable and the costs  can  reasonably  be
       estimated.   There were no environmental issues  noted  or
       liabilities recorded at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

     Fair Value Measurements

       As  of  December 31, 2010, the Company has  no  assets  or
       liabilities  measured at fair value on a  recurring  basis
       or nonrecurring basis.

     Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

       Management  has  reviewed recently  issued,  but  not  yet
       effective,  accounting pronouncements and does not  expect
       the  implementation  of  these pronouncements  to  have  a
       significant effect on the Company's financial statements.

     During  the  second and third quarter of 2009,  the  Company
     sold  15.329%  of  the Applebee's restaurant  in  Macedonia,
     Ohio,  in  two  separate transactions,  to  unrelated  third
     parties.   The Company received total net sale  proceeds  of

     cost  and  related accumulated depreciation of the interests
     sold was $480,533 and $39,946, respectively.

     During 2010, the Company sold an additional 47.0843% of  the
     Applebee's  restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio, in  six  separate
     transactions,  to  unrelated  third  parties.   The  Company
     received  total  net  sale  proceeds  of  $1,571,988,  which
     resulted  in  a net gain of $218,688.  The cost and  related
     accumulated   depreciation  of  the   interests   sold   was
     $1,475,997  and  $122,697,  respectively.   The  Company  is
     attempting  to sell its remaining 32.5589% interest  in  the
     property.   At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the property  was

     Unit,  respectively.  The Company anticipates the  remaining
     net  sale  proceeds will either be reinvested in  additional
     property or distributed to the Members in the future.

     The  financial  results for this property are  reflected  as
     Discontinued   Operations  in  the  accompanying   financial

(7)  Members' Capital - (Continued)

     As  part  of  the  Limited Members' distributions  discussed
     above, the Company distributed net sale proceeds of $105,700
     and $50,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.

     The  Company may acquire Units from Limited Members who have
     tendered  their  Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
     acquired  at a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated
     to  purchase in any year more than 2% of the total number of
     Units  outstanding on January 1 of such year.  In  no  event
     shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in  the
     sole discretion of the Managing Members, such purchase would
     impair the capital or operation of the Company.

     During  2010, two Limited Members redeemed a total of  46.92
     Units   for   $29,702  in  accordance  with  the   Operating
     Agreement.  The Company acquired these Units using Net  Cash
     Flow  from  operations.  During 2009, the  Company  did  not
     redeem  any Units from the Limited Members.  The redemptions
     increase  the remaining Limited Member's ownership  interest
     in  the  Company.  As a result of these redemption  payments
     and  pursuant  to  the  Operating  Agreement,  the  Managing
     Members received distributions of $918 in 2010.

     After  the  effect  of  redemptions,  the  Adjusted  Capital
     Contribution,  as  defined in the  Operating  Agreement,  is
     $1,011.02 per original $1,000 invested.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON
        ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

       None.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

       (a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

        Under  the  supervision  and with  the  participation  of
management, including its President and Chief Financial  Officer,
the Managing Member of the Company evaluated the effectiveness of
the   design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure  controls   and
procedures  (as  defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under  the  Securities
Exchange  Act  of  1934 (the "Exchange Act")).  Based  upon  that
evaluation,  the  President and Chief Financial  Officer  of  the
Managing  Member  concluded that, as of the  end  of  the  period
covered  by  this report, our disclosure controls and  procedures
were  effective  in  ensuring  that information  required  to  be
disclosed  by us in the reports that we file or submit under  the
Exchange  Act  is  recorded, processed, summarized  and  reported
within  the time periods specified in applicable rules and  forms
and  that  such  information is accumulated and  communicated  to
management,  including the President and Chief Financial  Officer
of  the Managing Member, in a manner that allows timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

       (b)  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

       (i) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.   The  Managing  Member, through  its  management,  is
responsible  for  establishing and maintaining adequate  internal
control  over  our financial reporting, as defined in  Rule  13a-
15(f) under the Exchange Act, and for performing an assessment of
the   effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over   financial
reporting  as  of  December  31,  2010.   Internal  control  over
financial  reporting is a process designed to provide  reasonable
assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting  and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes  in
accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles.   Our
system  of  internal  control over financial  reporting  includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of  records  that,  in reasonable detail, accurately  and  fairly
reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of  the
Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are
recorded   as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of   financial
statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being  made  only in accordance with authorizations of management
of  the  Managing Member; and (iii) provide reasonable  assurance
regarding   prevention  or  timely  detection   of   unauthorized
acquisition,  use,  or disposition of the Company's  assets  that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

        Management of the Managing Member performed an assessment
of  the  effectiveness  of our internal  control  over  financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010 based upon criteria in Internal
Control-Integrated   Framework  issued  by   the   Committee   of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway  Commission  ("COSO").
Based  on  our  assessment, management  of  the  Managing  Member
determined that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective  as  of  December 31, 2010 based  on  the  criteria  in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  (Continued)

        This annual report does not include an attestation report
of  our  registered  public accounting  firm  regarding  internal
control  over financial reporting.  Management's report  was  not
subject  to attestation by our registered public accounting  firm
pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission  that
permit  us  to  provide only management's report in  this  annual
report.

         (ii)    Changes  in  Internal  Control  Over   Financial
Reporting.  During the most recent period covered by this report,
there  has  been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange  Act)
that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely   to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATION.

       None.


                            PART III

ITEM 10.  DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

        The registrant is a limited liability company and has  no
officers,  directors, or direct employees.  The Managing  Members
manage  and  control  the  Company's  affairs  and  have  general
responsibility  and  the  ultimate  authority  in   all   matters
affecting the Company's business.  The Managing Members  are  AEI
Fund  Management  XXI,  Inc. ("AFM"), the  Managing  Member,  and
Robert  P. Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, President  and  sole
director  of AFM, the Special Managing Member.  AFM is  a  wholly
owned  subsidiary of AEI Capital Corporation of which Mr. Johnson
is  the  majority shareholder.  AFM has only one senior financial
executive,  its  Chief Financial Officer.   The  Chief  Financial
Officer  reports  directly to Mr. Johnson and is accountable  for
his actions to Mr. Johnson.  Although Mr. Johnson and AFM require
that  all  of  their  personnel, including  the  Chief  Financial
Officer, engage in honest and ethical conduct, ensure full, fair,
accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure, comply with  all
applicable  governmental laws, rules and regulations, and  report
to  Mr. Johnson any deviation from these principles, because  the
organization  is  composed of only approximately 35  individuals,
because  the  management  of a company  by  an  entity  that  has
different  interests in distributions and income  than  investors
involves numerous conflicts of interest that must be resolved  on
a  daily  basis, and because the ultimate decision maker  in  all
instances  is Mr. Johnson, AFM has not adopted a formal  code  of
conduct.   Instead,  the materials pursuant  to  which  investors
purchase Units disclose these conflicts of interest in detail and
Mr.  Johnson,  as  the  CEO and sole director  of  AFM,  resolves
conflicts  to  the  best  of  his ability,  consistent  with  his
fiduciary obligations to AFM and the fiduciary obligations of AFM
to the Company.  The director and officers of AFM are as follows:

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.
         (Continued)

        Robert  P.  Johnson, age 66, is Chief Executive  Officer,
President  and  sole director and has held these positions  since
the  formation  of AFM in August 1994, and has  been  elected  to
continue  in these positions until December 2011.  From  1970  to
the  present, he has been employed exclusively in the  investment
industry,  specializing in limited partnership  investments.   In
that capacity, he has been involved in the development, analysis,
marketing   and  management  of  public  and  private  investment
programs investing in net lease properties as well as public  and
private  investment  programs investing  in  energy  development.
Since 1971, Mr. Johnson has been the president, a director and  a
registered principal of AEI Securities, Inc., which is registered
with  the SEC as a securities broker-dealer, is a member  of  the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and is  a  member
of  the  Security Investors Protection Corporation  (SIPC).   Mr.
Johnson   has  been  president,  a  director  and  the  principal
shareholder   of  AEI  Fund  Management,  Inc.,  a  real   estate
management  company founded by him, since 1978.  Mr.  Johnson  is
currently  a general partner or principal of the general  partner
in nine limited partnerships and a managing member in five LLCs.

        Patrick  W.  Keene,  age 51, is Chief Financial  Officer,
Treasurer  and  Secretary  and has  held  these  positions  since
January  22,  2003  and  has been elected to  continue  in  these
positions  until December 2011.  Mr. Keene has been  employed  by
AEI  Fund  Management, Inc. and affiliated entities  since  1986.
Prior  to being elected to the positions above, he was Controller
of  the various entities.  From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Keene was  with
KPMG  Peat  Marwick  Certified Public Accountants,  first  as  an
auditor and later as a tax manager.  Mr. Keene is responsible for
all accounting functions of AFM and the registrant.

       Since Mr. Johnson serves as the Special Managing Member of
the  Company,  as well as the sole director of AFM,  all  of  the
duties  that might be assigned to an audit committee are assigned
to  Mr. Johnson.  Mr. Johnson is not an audit committee financial
expert, as defined.  As an officer and majority owner, through  a
parent  company, of AFM, and as the Special Managing Member,  Mr.
Johnson is not a "disinterested director" and may be subject to a
number of conflicts of interests in his capacity as sole director
of AFM.

        Before the independent auditors are engaged, Mr. Johnson,
as the sole director of AFM, approves all audit-related fees, and
all permissible nonaudit fees, for services of our auditors.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

        Under federal securities laws, the directors and officers
of  the Managing Member of the Company, and any beneficial  owner
of  more than 10% of a class of equity securities of the Company,
are  required  to report their ownership of the Company's  equity
securities  and  any changes in such ownership to the  Securities
and  Exchange Commission (the "Commission").  Specific due  dates
for  these  reports have been established by the Commission,  and
the  Company is required to disclose in this Annual Report on 10-
K  any delinquent filing of such reports and any failure to  file
such  reports  during the fiscal year ended  December  31,  2010.
Based upon information provided by officers and directors of  the
Managing Member, all officers, directors and 10% owners filed all
reports on a timely basis in the 2010 fiscal year.


ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

        The Managing Member and affiliates are reimbursed at cost
for  all  services performed on behalf of the registrant and  for
all  third party expenses paid on behalf of the registrant.   The
cost  for services performed on behalf of the registrant is based
on  actual  time spent performing such services plus an  overhead
burden.   These  services include organizing the  registrant  and
arranging  for the offer and sale of Units, reviewing  properties
for acquisition and rendering administrative, property management
and  property  sales  services.  The amount and  nature  of  such
payments are detailed in Item 13 of this annual report on Form 10-
K.

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
         MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

        The following table sets forth information pertaining  to
the ownership of the Units by each person known by the Company to
beneficially  own  5%  or  more of the Units,  by  each  Managing
Member, and by each officer or director of the Managing Member as
of February 28, 2011:

     Name and Address                   Number of     Percent
   of Beneficial Owner                  Units Held    of Class

   AEI Fund Management XXI, Inc.            0            0%
   Robert P. Johnson                        0            0%
   Patrick W. Keene                         0            0%

   Address for all:
   1300 Wells Fargo Place
   30 East 7th Street, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101

The  Managing Members know of no holders of more than 5%  of  the
outstanding Units.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
         DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

        The  registrant,  AFM  and  its  affiliates  have  common
management and utilize the same facilities.  As a result, certain
administrative  expenses  are  allocated  among   these   related
entities.   All  of  such activities and any  other  transactions
involving the affiliates of the Managing Member of the registrant
are  governed  by,  and  are conducted in  conformity  with,  the
limitations  set  forth  in  the  Operating  Agreement   of   the
registrant.   Reference  is  made to  Note  3  of  the  Financial
Statements,   as  presented,  and  is  incorporated   herein   by
reference,  for  details of related party  transactions  for  the
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

        Neither  the registrant, nor the Managing Member  of  the
registrant,  has a board of directors consisting of  any  members
who are "independent."  The sole director of the Managing Member,
Robert  P.  Johnson, is also the Special Managing Member  of  the
registrant,  and is the Chief Executive Officer,  and  indirectly
the  principal owner, of the Managing Member.  Accordingly, there
is  no  disinterested  board,  or other  functioning  body,  that
reviews  related party transactions, or the transactions  between
the  registrant and the Managing Members, except as performed  in
connection with the audit of its financial statements.


ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND
         DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.  (Continued)

        The  limitations  included  in  the  Operating  Agreement
require  that  the  cumulative  reimbursements  to  the  Managing
Members and their affiliates for certain expenses will not exceed
an  amount  equal to the sum of (i) 20% of capital contributions,
(ii)  1% of gross revenues, plus an initial leasing fee of 3%  of
gross  revenues for the first five years of the original term  of
each lease, (iii) 3% of Net Proceeds of Sale, and (iv) 10% of Net
Cash  Flow  less  the Net Cash Flow actually distributed  to  the
Managing Members. The cumulative reimbursements subject  to  this
limitation  are reimbursements for (i) organization and  offering
expenses, including commissions, (ii) acquisition expenses, (iii)
services  provided  in the sales effort of properties,  and  (iv)
expenses  of  controlling persons and overhead expenses  directly
attributable   to  the  forgoing  services  or  attributable   to
administrative   services.  As  of  December  31,   2010,   these
cumulative  reimbursements  to the  Managing  Members  and  their
affiliates did not exceed the limitation amount.

        The following table sets forth the forms of compensation,
distributions  and cost reimbursements paid by the registrant  to
the  Managing Members or their Affiliates in connection with  the
operation  of  the Fund and its properties for  the  period  from
inception through December 31, 2010.
