     information  presented not misleading.  It is  suggested  that
     these  condensed financial statements be read  in  conjunction

(2)  Organization - (Continued)

     Any  Net  Proceeds  of Sale, as defined, from  the  sale  or
     financing of properties which the Managing Members determine
     to distribute will, after provisions for debts and reserves,
     be  paid  in  the following manner: (i) first,  99%  to  the
     Limited  Members  and 1% to the Managing Members  until  the
     Limited  Members  receive  an amount  equal  to:  (a)  their
     Adjusted Capital Contribution plus (b) an amount equal to 7%
     of their Adjusted Capital Contribution per annum, cumulative
     but not compounded, to the extent not previously distributed
     from  Net  Cash  Flow; (ii) any remaining  balance  will  be
     distributed  90%  to  the Limited Members  and  10%  to  the
     Managing Members.  Distributions to the Limited Members will
     be made pro rata by Units.

     For  tax  purposes,  profits  from  operations,  other  than
     profits  attributable  to  the  sale,  exchange,  financing,
     refinancing  or  other  disposition  of  property,  will  be
     allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the  Managing
     Members.   Net losses from operations will be allocated  99%
     to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.

     For  tax purposes, profits arising from the sale, financing,

     first,  to  those  Members with deficit  balances  in  their
     capital  accounts  in an amount equal to  the  sum  of  such
     deficit  balances; (ii) second, 99% to the  Limited  Members
     and  1%  to the Managing Members until the aggregate balance
     in  the Limited Members' capital accounts equals the sum  of
     the Limited Members' Adjusted Capital Contributions plus  an
     amount  equal  to 7% of their Adjusted Capital Contributions
     per  annum, cumulative but not compounded, to the extent not
     previously  allocated;  (iii)  third,  the  balance  of  any
     remaining  gain  will then be allocated 90% to  the  Limited

     The  Managing Members are not required to currently  fund  a
     deficit capital balance.  Upon liquidation of the Company or
     withdrawal  by a Managing Member, the Managing Members  will
     contribute to the Company an amount equal to the  lesser  of
     the  deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01%  of
     the  total capital contributions of the Limited Members over
     the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(5)  Discontinued Operations -

     During  2010,  the Company sold 47.0843% of  the  Applebee's
     restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio, in six separate transactions,
     to  unrelated third parties.  The Company received total net
     sale proceeds of $1,571,988, which resulted in a net gain of
     $218,688.  The cost and related accumulated depreciation  of
     the    interests   sold   was   $1,475,997   and   $122,697,
     respectively.   For the three months ended March  31,  2011,
     the net gain was $28,180.

     On April 20, 2011, the Company sold an additional 6.5771% of
     the Applebee's restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio to an unrelated
     third  party.   The  Company received net sale  proceeds  of
     approximately  $223,000, which resulted in  a  net  gain  of
     approximately  $34,000.   The cost and  related  accumulated
     depreciation of the interest sold was $206,179 and  $17,139,
     respectively.   The  Company  is  attempting  to  sell   its
     remaining  25.9818% interest in the property.  At March  31,
     2011  and December 31, 2010, the property was classified  as
     Real Estate Held for Sale with a carrying value of $935,815.

     nonrecurring basis.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

        This  section contains "forward-looking statements" which
represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning  future
events, including statements regarding anticipated application of
cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the
sufficiency  of  cash  to  meet  operating  expenses,  rates   of
distribution,  and  other  matters.  These,  and  other  forward-
looking  statements,  should be evaluated in  the  context  of  a
number  of  factors  that  may  affect  the  Company's  financial
condition and results of operations, including the following:

    Market  and  economic conditions which affect the  value
    of  the  properties the Company owns and the cash  from
    rental income such properties generate;

    the  federal  income tax consequences of rental  income,
    deductions,  gain  on  sales and other  items  and  the
    effects of these consequences for Members;

    resolution  by  the Managing Members of  conflicts  with
    which they may be confronted;

    the   success  of  the  Managing  Members  of   locating
    properties with favorable risk return characteristics;

    the effect of tenant defaults; and

    the  condition of the industries in which the  tenants  of
    properties owned by the Company operate.


Application of Critical Accounting Policies

        The  preparation  of  the Company's financial  statements
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that  may
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues  and
expenses,  and  related  disclosure  of  contingent  assets   and
liabilities. Management evaluates these estimates on  an  ongoing
basis,   including  those  related  to  the  carrying  value   of
investments  in  real  estate  and the  allocation  by  AEI  Fund
Management, Inc. of expenses to the Company as opposed  to  other
funds they manage.

        The Company purchases properties and records them in  the
financial   statements   at  cost  (not   including   acquisition
expenses).     The   Company   tests   long-lived   assets    for
recoverability  when events or changes in circumstances  indicate
that  the  carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties
the  Company will hold and operate, management determines whether
impairment  has occurred by comparing the property's probability-
weighted  future undiscounted cash flows to its current  carrying
value.   For  properties  held  for sale,  management  determines
whether  impairment  has  occurred by  comparing  the  property's
estimated  fair  value less cost to sell to its current  carrying
value.   If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable
value,  an  impairment loss is recorded to  reduce  the  carrying
value  of  the property to its net realizable value.  Changes  in
these  assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in  the
carrying value of the properties.

        AEI  Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each  of
the  funds  they manage primarily on the basis of the  number  of
hours  devoted  by their employees to each fund's affairs.   They
also  allocate  expenses at the end of each month  that  are  not
directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number  of
investors  in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative  to
other  funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these  expenses
subject  to  detailed  limitations  contained  in  the  Operating
Agreement.


ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        Management  of the Company has discussed the  development
and   selection  of  the  above  accounting  estimates  and   the
management  discussion  and analysis disclosures  regarding  them
with the managing member of the Company.

Results of Operations

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010,  the
Company  recognized rental income from continuing  operations  of
$649,265  and  $616,676, respectively.  In  2011,  rental  income
increased  due  to  additional rent received  from  one  property
acquisition in 2010 and rent increases on five properties.  Based
on  the  scheduled rent for the properties owned as of April  30,
2011,  the  Company  expects  to  recognize  rental  income  from
continuing operations of approximately $2,598,000 in 2011.

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010,  the
Company  incurred  LLC  administration expenses  from  affiliated
parties   of   $89,663   and   $86,237,   respectively.     These
administration  expenses  include  costs  associated   with   the
management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting
requirements and communicating with the Limited Members.   During
the  same  periods,  the Company incurred LLC administration  and
property  management expenses from unrelated parties  of  $13,096
and  $10,384,  respectively.   These  expenses  represent  direct
payments  to  third  parties for legal and  filing  fees,  direct
administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes,  insurance  and
other property costs.

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010,  the
Company   recognized  interest  income  of  $4,444  and   $3,126,
respectively.   In  2011, interest income increased  due  to  the
Company having more money invested in a money market account  due
to property sales.

        Upon complete disposal of a property or classification of
a property as Real Estate Held for Sale, the Company includes the
operating  results  and  sale  of the  property  in  discontinued
operations.   In  addition, the Company  reclassifies  the  prior
periods'  operating  results  of  the  property  to  discontinued
operations.   For  the  three months ended March  31,  2011,  the
Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $20,884
representing rental income.  For the three months ended March 31,
2010,  the Company recognized income from discontinued operations
of  $77,273  representing rental income less property  management
expenses  of  $49,093  and gain on disposal  of  real  estate  of
$28,180.

        During  2010, the Company sold 47.0843% of the Applebee's
restaurant  in Macedonia, Ohio, in six separate transactions,  to
unrelated  third parties.  The Company received  total  net  sale
proceeds of $1,571,988, which resulted in a net gain of $218,688.
The  cost  and related accumulated depreciation of the  interests
sold  was  $1,475,997 and $122,697, respectively.  For the  three
months ended March 31, 2011, the net gain was $28,180.

        On April 20, 2011, the Company sold an additional 6.5771%
of  the  Applebee's restaurant in Macedonia, Ohio to an unrelated
third   party.   The  Company  received  net  sale  proceeds   of
approximately  $223,000,  which  resulted  in  a  net   gain   of
approximately   $34,000.   The  cost  and   related   accumulated
depreciation  of  the  interest sold was  $206,179  and  $17,139,
respectively.   The Company is attempting to sell  its  remaining
25.9818%  interest  in  the property.   At  March  31,  2011  and
December  31,  2010, the property was classified as  Real  Estate
Held for Sale with a carrying value of $935,815.


ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

         Management  believes  inflation  has  not  significantly
affected  income  from  operations.   Leases  may  contain   rent
increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over
a  specified period, which will result in an increase  in  rental
income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the
real  estate  to  appreciate in value.   However,  inflation  and
changing  prices  may  have an adverse impact  on  the  operating
margins  of  the  properties' tenants, which could  impair  their
ability  to  pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net  Cash  Flow
available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2011,  the
Company's  cash  balances  decreased  $100,312  as  a  result  of
distributions  paid to the Members in excess  of  cash  generated
from  operating activities.  During the three months ended  March
31,  2010,  the Company's cash balances increased $180,366  as  a
result  of  cash generated from the sale of property,  which  was
partially  offset by distributions paid to the Members in  excess
of cash generated from operating activities.

        Net  cash provided by operating activities increased from
$525,716  in 2010 to $551,405 in 2011 as a result of an  increase
in  total  rental  and  interest income in 2011  and  net  timing
differences  in the collection of payments from the  tenants  and
the  payment  of  expenses, which were  partially  offset  by  an
increase  in LLC administration and property management  expenses
in 2011.

        The  major  components of the Company's  cash  flow  from
investing activities are investments in real estate and  proceeds
from  the  sale  of real estate.  During the three  months  ended
March 31, 2010, the Company generated cash flow from the sale  of
real estate of $199,600.

        On October 20, 2010, the Company purchased a 21% interest
in a Scott & White Clinic in College Station, Texas for $771,868.
The  property is leased to Scott & White Healthcare under a Lease
Agreement with a remaining primary term of 9.7 years (as  of  the
date  of  purchase) and initial annual rent of  $64,680  for  the
interest purchased.  The remaining interests in the property were
purchased  by  AEI  Net  Lease Income & Growth  Fund  XX  Limited
Partnership and AEI Income & Growth Fund XXI Limited Partnership,
affiliates of the Company.

        The  Company's  primary  use of  cash  flow,  other  than
investment   in  real  estate,  is  distribution  and  redemption
payments  to Members.  The Company declares its regular quarterly
distributions  before  the  end of  each  quarter  and  pays  the
distribution  in  the first week after the end of  each  quarter.
The  Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from
quarter  to  quarter.  Redemption payments are paid to  redeeming
Members on a semi-annual basis.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

        For  the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010,  the
Company   declared  distributions  of  $544,949   and   $544,950,
respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions
of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3%
to  the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of  Sale
were  allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing
Members.   The Limited Members received distributions of $528,601
and  $528,601 and the Managing Members received distributions  of
$16,348  and $16,349 for the periods, respectively.  In  December
2010,  the  Company declared a special distribution of  net  sale
proceeds  of  $106,768, which resulted in a  higher  distribution
payable at December 31, 2010.

        The  Company may acquire Units from Limited  Members  who
have  tendered  their Units to the Company.  Such  Units  may  be
acquired  at  a discount.  The Company will not be  obligated  to
purchase  in any year more than 2% of the total number  of  Units
outstanding  on  January 1 of such year.  In no event  shall  the
Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion
of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or
operation of the Company.

       During the first three months of 2011, the Company did not
redeem any Units from the Limited Members.  On April 1, 2010, two
Limited  Members redeemed a total of 46.92 Units for  $29,702  in
accordance  with  the Operating Agreement.  The Company  acquired
these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations.  In prior years,
eight  Limited  Members  redeemed a total  of  415.48  Units  for
$305,680.    The  redemptions  increase  the  remaining   Limited
Members' ownership interest in the Company.  As a result of these
redemption payments and pursuant to the Operating Agreement,  the
Managing Members received distributions of $918 in 2010.

       The continuing rent payments from the properties, together
with  cash  generated from property sales, should be adequate  to
fund  continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations
on both a short-term and long-term basis.

The Economy and Market Conditions

       The impact of conditions in the current economy, including
the  turmoil  in the credit markets, has adversely affected  many
real  estate investment funds.  However, the absence of  mortgage
financing  on  the Company's properties eliminates the  risks  of
foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively  impact  the
value  and  distributions  of leveraged  real  estate  investment
funds.  Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely
affect  the  operations of the Company's tenants and  their  cash
flows.  If a tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the
Company's  income would decrease, its distributions would  likely
be reduced and the value of its properties might decline.

       Not required for a smaller reporting company.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

of  the Managing Member, in a manner that allows timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

       (b)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

        (i) During the most recent period covered by this report,
there  has  been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange  Act)
that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely   to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
