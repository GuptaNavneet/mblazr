<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Celladon Corporation (Celladon or the Company) should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 included in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, since they are interim statements, the accompanying financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial
statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements relate to the fair value of equity
awards and clinical trial expense accruals. Although these estimates are based on the Company&#146;s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and
assumptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Organization </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Celladon
was incorporated in California on December&nbsp;21, 2000 (inception) and reincorporated in Delaware in April 2012. The Company is a biotechnology company that has been focused on the development of cardiovascular gene therapy. As a consequence of
the negative results from the Phase 2b clinical trial of its lead product candidate, MYDICAR (AAV1/SERCA2a), the Company is evaluating its strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including the possibility of seeking a merger, sale of
the Company or all or some of its assets, and/or a liquidation. At this time, the Company&#146;s current development activities are limited to the oversight of the long-term follow up period in the CUPID 2 trial, which is expected to continue
through February 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of September&nbsp;30, 2015, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to product development,
raising capital and building infrastructure and has not generated revenues from product sales or other sources. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Principles of Consolidation </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial statements of the Company&#146;s former subsidiary Celladon Europe B.V. (Celladon Europe) were consolidated with those of the
Company through Celladon Europe&#146;s dissolution on December&nbsp;30, 2014. All intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation. </P>

securities primarily consist of investment grade corporate debt securities. The Company classifies all investment securities as available-for-sale. Investments with maturity dates greater than 12 months from the end of each reporting period are
classified as long-term. Investment securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) until realized. Realized gains and
losses from the sale of investment securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. A decline in the market value of any investment security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary will result in an impairment
charge to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. No such impairment charges were recorded for any period presented. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, none of the investment securities had been in an unrealized loss position for
more than 12 months. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method and are included in interest income. Interest income is recognized when earned.
During the third quarter of 2015 the Company&#146;s investment securities matured and the Company held the proceeds as cash equivalents. As of September&nbsp;30, 2015, the Company had no investment securities. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;)
No.&nbsp;2015-03,&nbsp;Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.&nbsp;The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15,
2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. The new guidance shall be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to
reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which defined management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt
about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related disclosure. ASU 2014-15 defined the term substantial doubt and requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date of the issuance of the financial
statements. It requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management&#146;s plans and requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated. The guidance
becomes effective for reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. </P>

paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of September&nbsp;30, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits with third-party
financial institutions and highly liquid money market securities with original maturities at date of purchase of 90 days or less and are stated at cost which approximate fair value and are classified within the Level 1 designation discussed above.
Marketable securities are recorded at fair value, defined as the exit price in the principal market in which the Company would transact, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. Level&nbsp;2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or discounted cash flow techniques and include
the Company&#146;s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper. Financial liabilities that were measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, and were classified within the Level 3 designation, included the warrant
liability and convertible notes prior to their conversion to equity upon the Company&#146;s initial public offering in February 2014. None of the Company&#146;s non-financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring
basis. No transfers between levels have occurred during the periods presented. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cash equivalents measured at fair value as of
September&nbsp;30, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014 are all classified within Level 1. As of September&nbsp;30, 2015, the Company had no investment securities. Below is a summary of other assets and liabilities measured at fair value (in thousands):

Company entered into a sublicense agreement (the AmpliPhi Sublicense) with AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation (AmpliPhi), pursuant to which AmpliPhi sublicensed to the Company certain rights under a separate agreement which AmpliPhi entered into in
2009 with the Trustees of University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). Under the terms of the AmpliPhi Sublicense, the Company obtained an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from AmpliPhi under certain UPenn patents related to AAV1 vectors for the development,
manufacture, use and sale of companion diagnostics to MYDICAR. In addition, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to companion diagnostics
under the agreement. Following the decision to not pursue additional previously planned development activities with MYDICAR and its companion diagnostic, the Company may not currently be in compliance with these milestone requirements and may in the
future choose to terminate the agreement. In consideration for the sublicense granted to the Company under the agreement, the Company paid to AmpliPhi a sublicense initiation fee of $310,000, and the Company is obligated to pay to AmpliPhi an annual
sublicense maintenance fee of $310,000. The Company is also required to pay to AmpliPhi a low single-digit percentage royalty based on net sales of any companion diagnostic covered by a licensed patent sold by the Company, its affiliates or its
sublicensees. The Company&#146;s royalty obligations continue on a companion diagnostic-by-companion diagnostic and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim in a licensed patent covering the applicable
companion diagnostic in such country. Finally, the Company is obligated to pay to AmpliPhi all royalty and milestone payments that become due and payable by AmpliPhi to UPenn under AmpliPhi&#146;s agreement with UPenn as a result of the
Company&#146;s exercise of the sublicense granted under the Company&#146;s agreement with AmpliPhi, including a low single-digit tiered percentage royalty on net sales of any companion diagnostic sold by the Company, its affiliates or its
sublicensees, which royalty is separate from and in addition to the royalty payable to AmpliPhi described above, and up to an aggregate of $850,000 in potential milestone payments per product covered by the licensed patents. </P>

AmpliPhi Sublicense that both amended the terms of the license agreement which the Company entered into with AmpliPhi in 2009 and terminated its manufacturing agreement with AmpliPhi which the Company entered into in 2009. Under the agreement, the
Company obtained an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patents and know-how related to AmpliPhi&#146;s AAV vector and manufacturing technology for the development, manufacture, use and sale of MYDICAR. In addition, the Company has agreed to
use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain diligence milestones with respect to the development and commercialization of at least one product covered by the UPenn patent rights licensed to AmpliPhi by UPenn under the Company&#146;s

the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones related to MYDICAR and any other product covered by the licensed patents. Through September&nbsp;30, 2015, no milestone obligations were incurred under the agreement. The agreement

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recorded the additional accruals as restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of
operations. The accrued restructuring balance as of September&nbsp;30, 2015, is presented as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets and is expected to be paid within the fourth quarter of 2015. The charges incurred during the nine
months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015, included $2.4 million related to employee severance costs, which impacted 25 employees who were notified of their termination prior to September&nbsp;30, 2015, $1.1 million related to retention payment accruals,
and $1.1 million related to facility lease termination costs. The Company expects to record an additional $0.3 million related to retention payments in the fourth quarter of 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following the announcement on June&nbsp;26, 2015, that the Company had suspended further research and development of its MYDICAR programs, the
Company determined that certain equipment used in the MYDICAR manufacturing process was impaired and an asset impairment charge of $0.2 million was recorded to restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations for the nine months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. The equipment was subsequently sold in September 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company may incur additional charges in

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2015, following the Company&#146;s announcements of the negative CUPID 2 data and the suspension of further research
and development activities and the subsequent declines of the price of the Company&#146;s common stock, three putative securities class action complaints (captioned&nbsp;Fialkov v. Celladon Corporation, Case No.&nbsp;15-cv-1458-AJB-DHB, Lorusso v.
Celladon Corporation, Case No.&nbsp;15-cv-1501-L-JLB and Jacobs v. Celladon Corporation, Case No.&nbsp;15-cv-1529-AJB-MDD ) were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the
Company&#146;s current and former officers. The complaints generally allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making materially false and misleading statements regarding the clinical
trial program for MYDICAR, thereby artificially inflating the price of the Company&#146;s common stock. The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief, including attorneys&#146; fees. The Company expects the court to consolidate
the three putative securities class actions and to appoint a lead plaintiff to represent the putative class.&nbsp;The Company then expects the lead plaintiff to file a consolidated complaint. It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or
allegations made by stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming the Company and/or the Company&#146;s officers and directors as defendants. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend
these lawsuits vigorously. Due to the early stage of these proceedings, the Company is not able to predict or reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome or possible losses relating to these claims. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a biotechnology company that has been focused on the development of cardiovascular gene therapy. As a consequence of the negative
results from the Phase 2b clinical trial of our lead product candidate, MYDICAR (AAV1/SERCA2a), we are evaluating our strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including the possibility of a merger or sale of our company, or all or some
of our assets, and/or a liquidation. Our ability to continue our operations involves numerous significant risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties set forth in Item&nbsp;1A under the heading &#147;Risk Factors&#148; of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently in the long-term follow-up stage of a 250-patient randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled multinational Phase 2b trial that was designed to evaluate MYDICAR in patients with heart failure for reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF (also referred to as systolic heart failure). We refer to this Phase 2b trial as the CUPID 2
trial. CUPID 2 evaluated a single, one-time, intracoronary infusion of the cardiovascular gene therapy agent MYDICAR versus placebo, in each case added to a maximal, optimized heart failure drug and device regimen. We completed enrollment of CUPID 2
in February 2014 and un-blinded the results from the active observation period in late April 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;26, 2015, we announced
that the CUPID 2 trial did not meet its primary and secondary endpoints and failed to show any treatment effect. Following our un-blinding of the CUPID 2 data, we implemented cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in workforce and termination
of certain contracts related to MYDICAR, and subsequently decided to not pursue additional previously planned development activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the second quarter of 2015, our board of directors approved, in two phases, an aggregate reduction of approximately 70% of our peak
workforce of 34 employees as of April&nbsp;30, 2015 in order to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources. The majority of employees included in this workforce reduction were separated during the second quarter of 2015, with the
remainder separated during the third quarter of 2015. We also committed to retention payments payable to certain key employees if such employees remain employed by us until December&nbsp;31, 2015 or are terminated by us without cause prior to such
date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;23, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the voluntary prepayment of the outstanding amounts due under our Loan and
Security Agreement with Hercules Technology III, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (as agent and as a lender, and together with Hercules Technology III, L.P., the &#147;Lenders&#148;) dated July&nbsp;31, 2014 (the &#147;Loan
Agreement&#148;), with such prepayment to be effected on August&nbsp;3, 2015 (the &#147;Prepayment Date&#148;).&nbsp;On the Prepayment Date, the Company paid the Lenders: (i)&nbsp;the $10.0 million outstanding principal balance, (ii)&nbsp;$0.1
million in accrued and unpaid interest, and (iii)&nbsp;an end of term charge of $1.8 million for a total payment of $11.8 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
September&nbsp;10, 2015, we entered into a Sublease Termination and Settlement Agreement (the &#147;Termination Agreement&#148;) with Brandes Investment Partners, L.P. (&#147;Brandes&#148;) providing for the termination of that certain Sublease
Agreement by and between us Brandes dated May&nbsp;28, 2014 (the &#147;Lease&#148;). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed to terminate the Lease, effective October&nbsp;31, 2015, which the parties subsequently extended to
November&nbsp;13, 2015 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;). We agreed to pay an early termination fee of $950,000 to Brandes in consideration of Brandes&#146; entry into the Termination Agreement and release of us from any further base rent or other
payment obligations that would otherwise arise pursuant to the Lease after the Effective Date. At this time, our current development activities are limited to the oversight of the long-term follow up period in the CUPID 2 trial, which is expected to
continue through February 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts
relating to our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and developing manufacturing capabilities, in-licensing related intellectual property, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our
intellectual property. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales or other sources. From our inception through September&nbsp;30, 2015, we have funded our operations primarily through the
sales of equity and debt securities totaling approximately $208.3 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception.
As of September&nbsp;30, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $186.1 million. Substantially all of our net losses, including those incurred during the periods presented in this report, have resulted from costs incurred in connection
with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot predict

principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs, in connection with our clinical trials, developing manufacturing capabilities and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical
trial materials. Prior to our reductions in force including all our research and development staff, we typically used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs. We expect our research and development
expenses to decrease compared to prior periods through the completion of the CUPID 2 trial in the first quarter of 2016 due to a reduction in workforce, the suspension of further research and development activities and reduced facility space and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our
obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may
result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of CROs and other third-party vendors.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our consolidated financial statements by matching those expenses
with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates
through discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust the rate of clinical trial expense
recognition if actual results differ from the estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect that our
estimates will be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting amounts that
are too high or too low for any particular period. Through September&nbsp;30, 2015, there had been no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot
assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials. </P>

milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for awards granted to non-employees using the fair-value
approach. These awards are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the fair value of our stock options
granted to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, (b)&nbsp;the expected volatility of our stock,
(c)&nbsp;the expected term of the award and (d)&nbsp;the expected dividend yield. Until our recently completed initial public offering, there was no public market for the trading of our common stock. Due to this fact and a lack of company specific
historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable
characteristics to ours, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data
using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information
regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the
original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S.&nbsp;Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Research and Development Expenses.</I> Research and development expenses were $0.7&nbsp;million and $5.3
million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease of approximately $4.6 million was primarily due to a decrease of $1.2 million in expenses incurred during the third quarter of 2015 associated with drug
substance manufacturing scale-up as a result of suspension of MYDICAR manufacturing activities, $1.1 million in stock based compensation and $0.8 million in compensation costs due to a reduction in workforce including all the research and
development staff, $0.9 million in clinical and preclinical costs, and $0.6 million in consulting and various other expenses. We anticipate a further reduction in our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future due to the suspension
of further development of MYDICAR and other pre-clinical programs and the reduction in workforce as we evaluate our strategic alternatives. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>General and Administrative Expenses.</I> General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million and $2.8 million for the three months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease of approximately $0.3 million was due to a decrease of $0.3 million in compensation costs due to a reduction in workforce as compared to the same period in 2014, $0.2 million in
pre-commercial planning costs due to the suspension of pre-commercial planning activities, $0.2 million in patent related costs, and $0.4 million in rent, recruiting and other administrative expenses offset by an increase of $0.3 million in
consulting costs and $0.2 million in legal and various other public company costs due to additional service fees incurred as a result of strategic planning activities, $0.2 million in depreciation expense as a result of a change in the estimated
useful life of certain assets, and $0.1 million in stock based compensation. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in the foreseeable future due to a reduction in workforce and the suspended activities related to
pre-commercial planning efforts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Restructuring Charges.</I> Restructuring charges were $1.8 million and zero for the three months
ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In light of the CUPID 2 results and following analysis of the CUPID 2 data in the second quarter of 2015, our board of directors, in two phases prior to September&nbsp;30, 2015, approved an
approximately 70% aggregate reduction of our peak workforce of 34 employees to reduce operating expenses and conserve cash resources. We have also committed to retention payments payable to certain key employees if such employees remain with
Celladon until December&nbsp;31, 2015 or are terminated by the Company without cause prior to such date. We suspended further research or development of our MYDICAR (AAV1/SERCA2a) program and our pre-clinical programs. The charges incurred during
the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015, included $1.1 million in facility lease termination costs, $0.6 million related to retention payment costs and $0.1 million related to employee severance costs. In connection with the restructuring
activities executed to date, we anticipate recording $0.3 million in charges related to retention payments in the fourth quarter of 2015. We have committed to approximately $3.8 million in aggregate charges related to employee severance and related
costs which are expected to be settled in 2015. We estimate that employee actions implemented to date will result in gross quarterly savings of approximately $1.5 million, which will be realized within research and development and within general and
administrative. We began to realize these savings in the second quarter of 2015 and expect to fully realize these savings by the end of 2015. We may incur additional charges in the future in connection with future restructuring activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other (Expense) Income.</I> Other expense was $1.3 million and $0.2 million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Other expense for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 consisted primarily of $1.3 million of expense related to the accelerated accretion of debt discount and interest charges on our term loan that was prepaid in full in
August 2015. Other expense for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014 consisted primarily of $0.3 million of expense related to the accretion of debt discount and interest charges on our prior term loan offset by $44,000 in interest and
other income. </P>

million for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of approximately $6.2 million was primarily due to an increase of $7.0 million in expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2015 associated with
drug substance manufacturing scale-up prior the negative results of the CUPID 2 trial, $0.9 million in preclinical costs and $0.1 million in rent expense, offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in clinical expenses due to completion of CUPID 2
clinical trial during the first quarter of 2015, a decrease of $0.2 million in stock-based compensation and $0.2 million in cash compensation costs due to reduction in force including all the research and development staff compared to the same

million in compensation costs related to both an increase in staff through May 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year and separation charges associated with the departure of our chief executive officer, $1.0 million in consulting and
public company related costs, and $0.2 million in depreciation expense offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in recruiting, investor relations and various other administrative costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in

financings, government or other third-party funding, strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements. On August&nbsp;3, 2015, we prepaid the outstanding amounts due under our loan facility with Hercules, including the $10 million

clinical trial program for MYDICAR, thereby artificially inflating the price of our common stock. The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief, including attorneys&#146; fees. We expect the court to consolidate the three
putative securities class actions and to appoint a lead plaintiff to represent the putative class.&nbsp;We then expect the lead plaintiff to file a consolidated complaint.&nbsp;It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations made
by stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. Due to the early stage of

or adverse reactions or events. Although extensive preclinical safety and biodistribution testing conducted on MYDICAR and other AAV vectors, including the CUPID 1 trial of MYDICAR for HFrEF and data from previous clinical trials of other AAV
vectors, suggests that MYDICAR will be well tolerated, known adverse side effects that could present with treatment with AAV vectors include an immunologic reaction to the capsid protein or gene at early time points after administration. In previous
clinical trials involving AAV viral vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced serious adverse events, including the development of a T-cell mediated immune response against the vector capsid proteins. In addition, theoretical adverse side
effects of AAV vectors include replication and spread of the virus to other parts of the body and insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the insertion of a gene near a gene that is important in cell growth or division results in
uncontrolled cell division, which could potentially enhance the risk of malignant transformation or cancer. Potential procedure-related events are similar to those associated with standard coronary diagnostic procedures, and may include vascular
injury (e.g., damage to the femoral, radial, or brachial arteries at the site of vascular access, or damage to the coronary arteries) or myocardial injury. If any such adverse events occur the product-related side effects could result in potential

regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or
restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product
development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In
addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. </P>

have agreements governing their activities, we will have limited influence over their actual performance. We will control only certain aspects of our CROs&#146; activities. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical
trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We and our principal investigators and CROs are required to comply with the FDA&#146;s and the ICH&#146;s (the International Conference on
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that
the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, enforce these GCPs through periodic
inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we, our principal investigators or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the
FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with GCPs. In
addition, our future clinical trials will require a sufficient number of patients to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient
number of patients, we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our CROs are

our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities that could harm our competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet
expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended,
delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates. If any such event were to occur, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates

delays in entering into new strategic partnership agreements related to product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. Moreover, we may
not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other collaborative arrangement for any future product candidates because the potential partner may consider that our research and development pipeline is insufficiently
developed to justify a collaborative effort, or that our product candidates and programs do not have the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the target population. Even if we are successful in establishing such a strategic
partnership or collaboration, we cannot be certain that, following such a strategic transaction or license, we will be able to progress the development and commercialization of the applicable product candidates as envisaged, or that we will achieve

operations.* </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which has the potential to substantially change health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and
significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for
covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of
prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal
government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United
States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with
recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes
aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013,
President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including physicians, hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers,
and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which
could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for any product candidates we seek to develop or additional pricing pressures. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2015, following our announcements of the negative CUPID 2 data and the suspension of further research and development activities and
the subsequent declines of the price of our common stock, three putative class action were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against us and certain of our current and former officers. The complaints generally
allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making materially false and misleading statements regarding the clinical trial program for MYDICAR, thereby artificially inflating the price of
our common stock. The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief, including attorneys&#146; fees. We expect the court to consolidate the three putative securities class actions and to appoint a lead plaintiff to represent the
putative class.&nbsp;We then expect the lead plaintiff to file a consolidated complaint.&nbsp;It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations made by stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming us
and/or our officers and directors as defendants. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. Due to the early stage of these proceedings, we are not able to predict or reasonably estimate the ultimate
outcome or possible losses relating to these claims. While we have directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance, there is no assurance that the coverage will be sufficient. In addition, any such litigation could result in substantial costs
and a diversion of management&#146;s attention and resources, which could harm our business. </P>

product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our
products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or
inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these
factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. </P>

numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and
flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of
contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under
applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of
these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be
held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental
laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply
with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result
in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although

operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or
prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on
acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to
delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. </P>

material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example,
the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security
breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of product candidates
could be delayed. </P>

financial condition. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many product candidates are manufactured and distributed using technically complex processes requiring
specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production
risks. While product batches released for use in clinical trials or for commercialization undergo sample testing, some defects may only be identified following product release. In addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved
process changes may result in these intermediate products not complying with stability requirements or specifications. Most of our product candidates must be stored and transported at temperatures within a certain range. If these environmental
conditions deviate, our product candidates&#146; remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their efficacy and safety could become adversely affected, making them no longer suitable for use. The occurrence or suspected occurrence of production and
distribution difficulties can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production
delays, substantial expense, lost sales and delays of new product launches. Any interruption in the supply of finished products or the loss thereof could hinder our ability to timely distribute our products and satisfy customer demand. Any
unforeseen failure in the storage of the product or loss in supply could delay our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues and operations. </P>

disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. A majority of our management operates in our principal executive offices located in San Diego, California. If our
San Diego offices were affected by a natural or man-made disaster, particularly those that are characteristic of the region, such as wildfires and earthquakes, or other business interruption, our ability to manage our domestic and foreign operations
could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our
headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our
business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial
expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>

are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.* </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biotechnology companies typically rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the
intellectual property related to product candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may
fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications
has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may challenge their
validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide
exclusivity for our product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Also, the setback to our MYDICAR development program that resulted from the failure of CUPID 2 could also reduce the benefits of patents covering MYDICAR
given the increased timeline to potential commercialization. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our programs and product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or
strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize
future products. Several patent applications covering our product candidates have been filed recently. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found
invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product
candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and
most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate. Furthermore, if third parties have
filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by a third party to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition,
patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if
patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and
confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidates discovery and development
processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into
confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade
secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be
breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and
any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other
confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized
disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse
against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether
to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA&#146;s disclosure policies may
change in the future, if at all. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in
protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no
guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or
otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that historically have been important to our business.* </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we are granted rights to intellectual property that historically have been
important to our business and we expect that we may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose on us, various development,
regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, payment of milestones and/or royalties and other obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to
terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we have done previously, we may
need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current product
candidates or future products in the absence of such a license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors
access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the
affected product candidates, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to
pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation. </P>

U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are

product candidate, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. In any such case, such a license may
not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Parties making claims against us for infringement of their intellectual
property rights may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve
substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we could be required to redesign our infringing products or obtain a license
from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be
non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. It may be impossible to redesign our products and technology, or it may require substantial time and monetary expenditure, which could force us to cease
commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, or some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, in any such proceeding, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages
and attorneys&#146; fees in the event we are found liable for willful infringement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary

addition, our product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party
intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources than we do,
may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage
over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. </P>

preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution&#146;s rights in technology resulting from the
collaboration. Regardless of such right of first negotiation for intellectual property, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may

unenforceable and/or is not infringed, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. A third-party defendant may also request post grant review or
<I>inter partes</I> review by the U.S. PTO of any patent we assert. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent

Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract
our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United

to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and
consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual
provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of
others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor&#146;s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure

protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development

patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to
pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The U.S. PTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,
documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by
other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product
candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or
unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous ground upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad,
even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our
patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or related. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain
that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part,
and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining
and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing
wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing
uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the
U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the recent
case, <I>Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,</I> the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. While we do not believe that any of the patents owned or licensed by us will be found invalid
based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. PTO may impact the value of our patents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and
our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as
federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and
into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories
where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them
from competing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign
jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology
products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could
result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke
third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property
rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P>

our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue operations, should we decide to continue our historical
business operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more
transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may
also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to our 2013 equity incentive plan, or the 2013 plan, our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based
awards to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2013 plan will automatically increase on January&nbsp;1 of each year by 5% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on
December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. In addition, we may grant or provide for the grant of rights to purchase shares of
our common stock pursuant to our 2013 employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on January&nbsp;1 of each calendar year by the lesser of 1% of the
total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year and 384,307 shares, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year.
Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 plan and ESPP each year. Increases in the number of shares available for future grant or purchase may result in additional dilution, which could
cause our stock price to decline. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future grant inducement grants to prospective employees and consultants, which may result in further dilution and cause our stock price to decline. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an &#147;ownership
change,&#148; generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation&#146;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such
as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have determined that several ownership changes have occurred since our inception and have reduced our deferred tax asset accordingly. We may also experience ownership
changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to
limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any

currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition our ability to pay dividends
is currently restricted by the terms of our loan agreement with Hercules. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. </P>

General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an

our initial public offering of our common stock. Pursuant to the registration statement, we registered the offer and sale of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock. On February&nbsp;4, 2014, we sold 5,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public
offering price of $8.00 per share and on February&nbsp;27, 2014, we sold 825,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares.
The offering has terminated. The sole book-running managing underwriter for the offering was Barclays Capital Inc. After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs paid by us of $6.3 million, the net proceeds from the offering
were approximately $44.3 million. No offering expenses were paid or are payable, directly or indirectly, to our directors or officers, to persons owning 10% or more of any class of our equity securities, or to any of our affiliates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The net proceeds from our initial public offering were invested in highly-liquid money market funds and investment grade corporate debt
securities, pending their use. As of September&nbsp;30, 2015, we have used all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering. We used the net proceeds to fund continued development of MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure, other
ongoing preclinical and research programs, and working capital and other general corporate purposes, including costs and expenses associated with being a public company. We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net
proceeds from our initial public offering. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
