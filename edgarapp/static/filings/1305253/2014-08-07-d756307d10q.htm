<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Celladon Corporation (Celladon or the Company) should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 included in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, since they are interim statements, the accompanying financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial
statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) that are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not
necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements relate to the fair value of equity
awards and clinical trial expense accruals. Although these estimates are based on the Company&#146;s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and
assumptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Organization </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Celladon
was incorporated in California on December&nbsp;21, 2000 (inception) and reincorporated in Delaware in April 2012. The Company is a biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for heart failure, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.
Celladon&#146;s lead product candidate targets SERCA2a, an enzyme that becomes deficient in patients with heart failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of
June&nbsp;30, 2014, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to product development, raising capital and building infrastructure and has not generated revenues from its planned principal operations. Accordingly, the Company is
considered to be in the development stage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Initial Public Offering </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2014, the Company completed its initial public offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $8.00 per
share, which included the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 825,000 additional shares of common stock. The Company received gross proceeds of $50.6 million and incurred $6.3 million in issuance costs, resulting in net proceeds
to the Company of $44.3 million. In connection with the initial public offering, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock, the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Company&#146;s
outstanding convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock and the unamortized debt discount related to the convertible notes was charged to expense, warrants to purchase shares of Series A-1 preferred stock were converted into
warrants to purchase common stock, the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, and the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to authorize 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000
shares of undesignated preferred stock. See Note 6 for additional information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Principles of Consolidation </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2012, Celladon formed a subsidiary, Celladon Europe B.V. (Celladon Europe). From its inception to June&nbsp;6, 2013, the subsidiary
was approximately 90% owned by Celladon and subsequent to June&nbsp;6, 2013 the subsidiary has been wholly owned by Celladon. The financial statements of Celladon Europe are consolidated with those of the Company. All intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Celladon Europe. The Company remeasures Celladon Europe&#146;s assets and liabilities related to monetary assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records
the net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Since the formation of Celladon Europe, the Company did not record any material gains or losses from
remeasurement. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Investment securities primarily consist of investment grade corporate debt securities. The Company classifies all investment securities as
available-for-sale. Investments with maturity dates greater than 12 months from the end of each reporting period are classified as long-term. Investment securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. A decline in the
market value of any investment security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary will result in an impairment charge to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. No such impairment charges were recorded for any
period presented. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, none of the investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related
security as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method and are included in interest income. Interest income is recognized when earned. </P>

information in the statements of income, cash flows and shareholder equity, b) amends Topic 275 to clarify that the risk and uncertainty disclosure requirements apply to entities that have not
commenced principal operations, c) eliminates the exception related to the sufficiency of equity at risk for development stage entities from the guidance on variable interest entities in paragraph 810-10-15-16 to increase consistency in application
of consolidated guidance across all entities and d) removes the definition of <I>development stage entities</I> from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments in this Update are to be applied retrospectively except
for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014, with an option for early adoption. The Company does
not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. </P>
 <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. Celladon Europe B.V. </B></P>
 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April&nbsp;2012 and June 2012, Cooperatief LSP IV U.A. (LSP) invested an aggregate of $4.8&nbsp;million in Celladon
Europe. In exchange for the investment, the Company issued LSP one share of Special Preferred Voting stock and Celladon Europe issued LSP 1,999 non-voting B shares. The 1,999 B shares were exchangeable into 10,716,405 shares of the Company&#146;s
Series&nbsp;A-1 preferred stock at the option of LSP. The Company determined that the investment held by LSP in Celladon Europe should be classified as a redeemable non-controlling interest, as the shares of Celladon Europe were not in-substance
common stock. In-substance common stock is an investment in an entity that has risk and reward characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity&#146;s common stock. Due to the liability characteristics associated with the shares of
Celladon Europe held by LSP, the Company concluded that LSP&#146;s shares were not substantially similar to common stock. The liability characteristics include LSP&#146;s put rights, which provided LSP with the ability to exchange its shares in
Celladon Europe for Series A-1 preferred stock of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The redeemable non-controlling interest was initially valued using the
fair value of the Series&nbsp;A-1 preferred stock. At each reporting period, the Company adjusted the carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest by the net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest. Any difference
between the fair value and the adjusted carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital and presented as a component of net loss attributable to common stockholders in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;6, 2013, LSP delivered a notice to exchange its
1,999 B shares of Celladon Europe for 10,716,405 shares of the Company&#146;s Series A-1 preferred stock. Concurrently, the one share of outstanding Special Preferred Voting stock was cancelled. As of June&nbsp;6, 2013, the redeemable
non-controlling interest was adjusted to fair value and reclassified to Series A-1 preferred stock on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From April 2012 through June&nbsp;6, 2013, LSP owned approximately 10% of Celladon Europe. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2013, the Company adjusted the loss attributable to common stockholders as a result of increases in
the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interest of approximately $3.1&nbsp;million. The increase in fair value increased the loss attributable to common stockholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2014, the Company completed the transfer of the open clinical site contracts from Celladon Europe to Celladon. As of June&nbsp;30,
2014, there were no liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating Celladon Europe. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the $0.8&nbsp;million of liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating Celladon Europe did not represent additional claims
on the Company&#146;s general assets; rather, they represented claims against the specific assets of Celladon Europe. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, the $0.1&nbsp;million and $0.6&nbsp;million, respectively, of assets
recognized as a result of consolidating Celladon Europe did not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company&#146;s general assets. The assets of Celladon Europe represent the only significant assets of the
Company not located in the United States. </P>

payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying value of these financial instruments generally approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. Investment securities are recorded at fair value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major
asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such
assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions </P>

institutions and highly liquid money market securities with original maturities at date of purchase of 90 days or less and are stated at cost which approximate fair value and are classified within the Level 1 designation discussed above. Marketable
securities are recorded at fair value, defined as the exit price in the principal market in which the Company would transact, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. Level&nbsp;2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or discounted cash flow techniques and include the
Company&#146;s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper. Financial liabilities that were measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, and were classified within the Level 3 designation, included the warrant
liability and convertible notes prior to their conversion to equity upon the Company&#146;s initial public offering in February 2014. None of the Company&#146;s non-financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring

AmpliPhi to UPenn under AmpliPhi&#146;s agreement with UPenn as a result of the Company&#146;s exercise of the sublicense granted under the Company&#146;s agreement with AmpliPhi, including a low single-digit tiered percentage royalty on net sales
of any companion diagnostic sold by the Company, its affiliates or its sublicensees, which royalty is separate from and in addition to the royalty payable to AmpliPhi described above, and up to an aggregate of $850,000 in potential milestone
payments per product covered by the licensed patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company may unilaterally terminate the agreement upon 30 days&#146; written

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has recorded research and development expense related to sublicense fees under the agreement of $0.9 million for the period from
December&nbsp;21, 2000 (inception) to June&nbsp;30, 2014. The Company recorded $0.3 million in each of the six month periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 and June&nbsp;30, 2013. Through June&nbsp;30, 2014, no milestone obligations were incurred under
the agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Amended and Restated License Agreement </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company entered into an amended and restated license agreement with AmpliPhi concurrently with the AmpliPhi Sublicense that both amended
the terms of the license agreement which the Company entered into with AmpliPhi in 2009 and terminated its manufacturing agreement with AmpliPhi which the Company entered into in 2009. Under the agreement, the Company obtained an exclusive,
worldwide license under certain patents and know-how related to AmpliPhi&#146;s AAV vector and manufacturing technology for the development, manufacture, use and sale of MYDICAR. In addition, the Company has agreed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to meet certain diligence milestones with respect to the development and commercialization of at least one product covered by the UPenn patent rights licensed to AmpliPhi by UPenn under the Company&#146;s agreement with UPenn. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. During the term of the agreement, the Company is not obligated to
make annual license or maintenance payments, but is obligated to pay to AmpliPhi all royalty and milestone payments that become due and payable by AmpliPhi to UPenn under&nbsp;AmpliPhi&#146;s agreement with UPenn as a result of the Company&#146;s
exercise of the sublicense granted under the Company&#146;s agreement with AmpliPhi. This includes a low single-digit tiered percentage royalty on net sales of MYDICAR and any other product covered by the licensed patents sold by the Company, its
affiliates or its sublicensees, and up to $850,000 in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones related to MYDICAR and any other product covered by the licensed patents. Through June&nbsp;30, 2014,
$0.3 million of milestone obligations were incurred under the agreement. The agreement does not provide either party with termination rights and does not have a provision for expiration or automatic termination. </P>

right to prosecute and maintain the applicable patent family. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company made an upfront payment to UMinn of $120,000. In addition, the

the agreement or as joint ownership interest in the licensed technology, (3)&nbsp;receives a certain amount in license and sublicense revenues under the agreement, (4)&nbsp;files an investigational new drug application, or IND, new drug application,
biologic license application or orphan drug application (or a foreign equivalent of any such application) for a product covered by the licensed technology, or (5)&nbsp;enters into any agreement with a third party to market or use the licensed

breach, or 30 days in the case of a non-payment breach. Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of all active claims in any licensed patent or patent application, which is expected to occur no earlier

the right to convert up&nbsp;to $3.0&nbsp;million of scheduled principal installments of the Loan into shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, provided such shares must be freely tradable. The number of shares of common stock that would be issued
upon conversion would be equal to the number determined by dividing (x)&nbsp;the principal amount to be paid in shares of common stock by (y)&nbsp;$16.33. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants (affirmative and negative) of the Company, including
restrictive covenants that limit the Company&#146;s ability to: incur additional indebtedness; encumber the collateral securing the Loan; acquire, own or make investments; repurchase or redeem stock or other equity securities; declare or pay any
cash dividend or make a cash distribution on any class of stock or other equity interest; transfer a material portion of the Company&#146;s assets; acquire other businesses; and merge or consolidate with or into any other business organization. The
Loan Agreement does not however include any financial maintenance covenants. The Loan Agreement also includes standard events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, a material impairment
in the perfection or priority of the Lenders&#146; security interest or in the value of the collateral, and events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be
applied to the outstanding Loan, and the Lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as are set forth in the Loan Agreement. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company applying our leadership position in the field of gene therapy and calcium dysregulation to
develop novel therapies for diseases with tremendous unmet medical needs. Our therapeutic portfolio for diseases characterized by SERCA enzyme deficiency includes both gene therapies and small molecule compounds. MYDICAR, our most advanced product
candidate, uses gene therapy to target SERCA2a, which is an enzyme that becomes deficient in patients with heart failure. MYDICAR utilizes a recombinant AAV1 serotype, which is a group of adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs, sharing specific antigens,
to deliver the gene for the SERCA2a enzyme. We believe that our gene therapy approach to modulating SERCA2a overcomes the issues encountered by previous efforts and has the potential to provide transformative disease-modifying effects with long-term
benefits in patients with heart failure. In addition, we have recently in-licensed worldwide rights to patents covering an additional gene therapy product opportunity, the membrane-bound form of Stem Cell Factor, or mSCF, for the treatment of
cardiac ischemic damage. We have also identified a number of potential first-in-class compounds addressing novel targets in diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases with our small molecule platform of SERCA2b modulators. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently evaluating MYDICAR in a 250-patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international Phase 2b trial in patients
with systolic heart failure, which we refer to as CUPID 2. We completed enrollment of CUPID 2 in February 2014 and expect to announce results in April 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have developed a companion diagnostic to identify the patients who are AAV1 neutralizing antibody, or NAb, negative and therefore eligible
for&nbsp;MYDICAR treatment. We believe approximately 40% of patients in the United States are AAV1 NAb negative. In an effort to expand the population of heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction that may be eligible for MYDICAR treatment, we
are currently exploring whether plasma exchange can be used to remove AAV1 neutralizing antibodies from the circulation in advance of MYDICAR administration. In late 2014, we plan to initiate a pilot, 24 patient, Phase 1/2 study of MYDICAR in
advanced heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction and pre-existing levels of neutralizing antibodies against the AAV1 vector, who will undergo plasma exchange prior to administration of MYDICAR. Initial results from this study are expected
in 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2014, the FDA&#146;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to
MYDICAR for reducing hospitalizations for heart failure in patients who test negative for adeno-associated viral vector 1, or AAV1, neutralizing antibodies, are class III or&nbsp;IV heart failure patients under the New York Heart Association, or
NYHA, classification system, and are not in immediate need of a left-ventricular assist device, or LVAD, or heart transplant. The Breakthrough Therapy program is intended to expedite drug development and review of innovative new drugs that are
intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on a clinically significant endpoint. MYDICAR was the third
product candidate to receive this designation from CBER, and the designation indicates that the FDA has determined that the CUPID 1 trial provided preliminary clinical evidence that MYDICAR may demonstrate substantial improvement over available
therapies in heart failure patients for which the designation was granted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are initially developing MYDICAR to treat patients with
systolic heart failure. Heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is characterized by a decreased contraction of the heart muscle. We are also developing MYDICAR for additional indications, including arteriovenous fistula, or AVF, maturation
failure, and for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure who are on a left-ventricular assist device, or LVAD. In addition, we expect to initiate a clinical trial in 2015 for the treatment of diastolic heart failure, a condition caused
by the inability of the heart to relax normally between contractions. MYDICAR has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of this condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We hold worldwide rights to MYDICAR in all indications and markets. We plan to commercialize MYDICAR for any approved heart failure
indications using a targeted sales force in the United States focused on selected cardiologists and heart failure specialists who treat the majority of heart failure patients. We believe we can maximize the value of our company by retaining
substantial commercialization rights to our product candidates and, where appropriate, entering into partnerships for specific therapeutic indications and/or geographic territories. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2014, we entered into a material transfer and exclusivity agreement with Les Laboratories Servier, or Servier, for the purpose of
enabling Servier to conduct an evaluation of our small molecule compounds that modulate the SERCA2b enzyme. As part of this agreement, we granted Servier an option to enter into a license and research collaboration agreement for the joint
collaboration, research and development of these compounds for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases, pursuant to which Servier may obtain an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to commercialize one or more of these compounds
and any related products in the field of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases outside of the United States. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2014, we completed our initial public offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at
an offering price of $8.00 per share, which included the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 825,000 additional shares of common stock. We received gross proceeds of $50.6 million and incurred $6.3 million in issuance costs,
resulting in net proceeds to us of $44.3 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2014, we in-licensed world-wide rights to gene therapy applications for mSCF
for treatment of cardiac ischemia from Enterprise Partners Management, LLC. Our initial focus with the program will be to generate clinically acceptable gene therapy vectors in support of potentially conducting a future clinical trial in patients
who have suffered cardiac damage, as well as exploration of other potential applications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2014, we entered into a Loan and
Security Agreement with Hercules Technology III, L.P. and Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. under which we may borrow up to $25.0 million in two tranches. We borrowed the first tranche of $10.0 million on August&nbsp;1, 2014. We plan to use
the proceeds of the Loan and Security Agreement to support our product candidate pipeline and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The second tranche of up to $15.0 million can be drawn anytime through May&nbsp;31, 2015, but only if
data from our Phase 2b clinical trial for MYDICAR supports the continued development of MYDICAR for its Breakthrough Therapy designation to either a Phase 3 clinical trial or for registration for approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a development-stage company. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development efforts relating
to our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and developing manufacturing capabilities, in-licensing related intellectual property, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual
property. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales or other sources. From our inception through June&nbsp;30, 2014, we have funded our operations primarily through the sales of equity and
convertible debt securities totaling approximately $168.5 million, which includes the net proceeds from our initial public offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of approximately $126.7 million. Substantially all our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in
connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We

with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates
through discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust the rate of clinical trial expense
recognition if actual results differ from the estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect that our
estimates will be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting amounts that
are too high or too low for any particular period. Through June&nbsp;30, 2014, there had been no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure
you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials. </P>

period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the
achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for stock options granted to
non-employees using the fair-value approach. These options are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the
fair value of our stock options granted to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, (b)&nbsp;the expected
volatility of our stock, (c)&nbsp;the expected term of the award and (d)&nbsp;the expected dividend yield. Until our recently completed initial public offering, there was no public market for the trading of our common stock. Due to this fact and a
lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies
with comparable characteristics to ours, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical
volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of
historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the
vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S.&nbsp;Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. </P>

million for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase of approximately $0.8 million was due primarily to an increase of $1.1 million in expenses incurred during the second quarter of 2014 associated with drug
substance manufacturing scale-up, $0.4 million in compensation related to an increase in headcount and $0.3 million in stock-based compensation offset by a $1.0 million decrease in clinical costs due to the completion of enrollment in our CUPID2
trial in the first quarter of 2014. We expect that our overall research and development expenses will continue to increase in 2014 as we initiate additional clinical trials and continue scale-up activities. </P>

June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase of approximately $1.2 million was due primarily to an increase of $0.5 million in compensation related to an increase in headcount, $0.3 million in fees associated with being a public company,
$0.3 million in stock-based compensation and $0.1 million in travel and other costs. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to operate as a public company. We believe that these increases will likely
include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional personnel to support product commercialization efforts and increased fees for outside consultants, attorneys and accountants. We also
expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations and disclosures, and similar requirements applicable to public companies. </P>

expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates and companion diagnostic. We expect to
incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates and companion diagnostic, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for

CUPID 2 trial, MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure in patients with existing LVADs and AVF maturation failure, internal salaries and external costs related to completion of our CUPID 2 trial and the remainder to fund working capital,

Growth Capital, Inc. and its affiliate Hercules Technology III, L.P., which we refer to collectively as Hercules or the Lenders, in August 2014 we borrowed $10.0 million from the Lenders and we have the option to borrow up to $15.0 million through
May&nbsp;31, 2015, subject to the satisfaction of certain funding conditions related to our clinical development of MYDICAR. The loan agreement requires us to comply with restrictive covenants, including restrictive covenants that limit our ability
to incur additional indebtedness; encumber the collateral securing the loan agreement; acquire, own or make investments; repurchase or redeem stock or other equity securities; declare or pay any cash dividend or make a cash distribution on any class
of stock or other equity interest; transfer a material portion of our assets; acquire other businesses; or merge or consolidate with or into any other business organization. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions to borrow additional amounts, we
may not be able to draw-down additional funds from the loan agreement. Moreover, an uncured breach of any of the covenants or other event of default under the loan agreement could lead to an event of default under the loan agreement. If any event of
default occurs, then outstanding amounts under the loan agreement may become due and payable immediately, but we may not have access to such amounts on reasonable terms or at all, which could harm our liquidity, business, financial condition,
operating results and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we enter into additional debt or credit financing arrangements with the consent of our existing
lenders, the terms of such additional debt or credit arrangements could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. In the event we must cease operations and liquidate our assets, the rights of our existing lenders and any other holder
of our outstanding debt would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*We will

development and other product candidates through preclinical development. Developing products is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we
advance our product candidates in clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. As of
June&nbsp;30, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and investments were $51.2 million. Our research and development expenses were $10.2 million and $7.1 million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, we plan to
develop MYDICAR for additional indications including treatment of AVF maturation failure and for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure who are on an LVAD. In addition, in late 2014 we plan to initiate a pilot, 24 patient, Phase 1/2
study of MYDICAR in advanced heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction and pre-existing levels of neutralizing antibodies against the AAV1 vector, who will undergo plasma exchange prior to administration of MYDICAR. We also expect to initiate
a clinical trial in 2015 for the treatment of diastolic heart failure, a condition caused by the inability of the heart to relax normally between contractions, if data from our preclinical research warrants. We believe that our existing cash, cash
equivalents and investments will enable us to fund our operations through 2015. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases beyond our expectations in spending on development programs or more rapid progress of development
programs than anticipated. We do not expect our existing capital resources to be sufficient to enable us to begin a Phase 3 trial of MYDICAR for systolic heart failure, if required. Furthermore, our operating plan may change as a result of many
factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates and companion
diagnostic, as well as to further develop MYDICAR for additional indications, such as AVF maturation failure, the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis undergoing surgery for AVF creation, the treatment of patients with
advanced heart failure who are on an LVAD, and to potentially develop MYDICAR for diastolic heart failure. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are
favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their
day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and companion diagnostic. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms
acceptable to us, if at all. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than would otherwise be ideal and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our
technologies, product candidates or our companion diagnostic, or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. </P>

development of MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. Although we are in preclinical development of MYDICAR for the treatment of diastolic heart failure and our small
molecule product candidates are in preclinical development for the treatment of diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, our ability to generate product revenues and to achieve commercial success in the near term will initially depend almost
entirely on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure in the United States and the European Economic Area, or EEA. Before we can market
and sell MYDICAR in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, we will need to commence and complete additional clinical trials, manage clinical and manufacturing activities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA in the United States,
from the EMA in the EEA, and from other foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions for both MYDICAR and its companion diagnostic, obtain manufacturing supply, build a commercial organization or enter into a marketing collaboration with a
third party, and in some jurisdictions, obtain reimbursement authorization, among other things. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the necessary clinical trials and/or obtain regulatory approvals and sufficient
commercial manufacturing supply for MYDICAR or its companion diagnostic. To date, no gene therapy product has ever been approved in the United States. If we do not receive regulatory approvals, our business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of MYDICAR. If we fail to successfully commercialize MYDICAR, we may be unable to generate
sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*MYDICAR is based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently
obtaining regulatory approval. At the moment, no gene therapy product has been approved in the United States and only one gene therapy product has been approved in Europe. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have primarily concentrated our research and development efforts on our lead product candidate, MYDICAR, for the treatment of systolic heart

significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. In addition, our product development program is dependent on the development and commercialization of a required companion diagnostic by us or by third party
collaborators. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and those diagnostic tools must independently be cleared or approved by the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities before we may commercialize our
product candidates. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or
commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA
and other foreign regulatory authorities, and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential
products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. For example, the FDA has
required us to conduct a safety and efficacy trial of patients with pre-existing NAbs to the AAV-based vectors </P>

used by MYDICAR as well as a viral shedding trial to determine the dissemination of our MYDICAR vector particles into the environment. At the moment, no gene therapy product has been approved in
the United States and only one gene therapy product, UniQure&#146;s Glybera, which received marketing authorization from the EMA in 2012, has been approved in Europe but has not yet been launched for commercial sale, which makes it difficult to
determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either the United States or Europe. Approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Gene therapy
clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146; Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee, or the RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its initiation.
Conversely, the FDA can put an investigational new drug application, or IND, on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review. For example, our IND for MYDICAR, which we filed with the FDA in December 2006, was placed on clinical
hold by the FDA in May 2012 until detailed, updated manufacturing information was submitted and the clinical hold was removed by the FDA in July 2012. Also, before a clinical trial can begin at an NIH-funded institution, that institution&#146;s
institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products
conducted by others may cause the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities to change the requirements for approval of any of our gene therapy-based product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These regulatory review committees and advisory groups, and the new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process,
require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval
limitations or restrictions. As we advance the development of our gene therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be
required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approvals necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate
sufficient product revenue to maintain our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*Failure to successfully validate, commercialize and obtain regulatory approval for our
companion diagnostic could delay or prevent commercialization of MYDICAR. Devices used in the administration of MYDICAR may also require labeling changes and result in delays for the commercialization of MYDICAR. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A key element of our strategy is to screen out patients with certain amounts of pre-existing NAbs to the AAV1 viral vector used by MYDICAR. We
have developed a companion diagnostic that will be used in combination with MYDICAR to help us better identify those patients that may benefit from treatment with MYDICAR. Although we are currently exploring whether a plasma exchange procedure can
be used to remove AAV1 neutralizing antibodies from advanced heart failure patients to enable their treatment with MYDICAR, such a procedure may ultimately prove to be unsafe, ineffective or cost prohibitive, and we cannot predict with certainty
when, if ever, such a procedure could successfully be implemented on a broad basis or whether such a procedure would be covered for reimbursement by third-party payors. Accordingly, we will be dependent on such companion diagnostic, both during our
clinical trials and in connection with any future commercialization of MYDICAR for systolic heart failure or for other indications. We expect that we will enter into a strategic alliance with a third party for the automation and commercialization of
our companion diagnostic. We and any of our future collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing the companion diagnostic for commercial application, including issues in relation to automation, selectivity/specificity, analytical
validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of such companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory
clearance or approval prior to commercialization. In the case of MYDICAR, we anticipate that the FDA will require approval of the companion diagnostic under a medical device pre-market approval, or PMA, application prior to, or concurrently with,
approval and commercialization of MYDICAR, which could delay our ability to commercialize both products. If we or any of our future collaborators fail to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic or are delayed in receiving such
approval, our ability to commercialize MYDICAR would be delayed until such time as regulatory approval is obtained. In addition, our future collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion
diagnostic, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostic in the clinical community. MYDICAR and certain of the off-the-shelf administration components used in the cardiac catheterization
laboratory are regulated as combination products. These include products where two or more separate products are packaged together (e.g., drug and device products); or a product packaged separately but intended for use only with an approved,
individually specified product where both are required to achieve the intended use of the proposed product. MYDICAR will include labelling that specifies certain administration products, and the labeling of some of the administration products may
need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, which revisions could delay our ability to commercialize MYDICAR. </P>

trial, we may experience difficulties enrolling the requisite number of patients for subsequent clinical trials, including additional trials that may be required by the FDA for the approval of MYDICAR. For example, one significant obstacle to the
timely recruitment and enrollment of a sufficient number of eligible patients in a Phase 3 trial of MYDICAR, if required, is the high prevalence of certain pre-existing NAbs to the viral vector used by MYDICAR, with, we believe, approximately 60% of
potential patients in the United States exhibiting these antibodies. In other countries, such as Poland, the prevalence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs is significantly higher. These antibodies neutralize the effectiveness of AAV-based vectors, such as
MYDICAR, and although we are able to prescreen for the presence of these antibodies, the high prevalence of these antibodies in humans reduces the pool of available trial participants. In addition, because therapy with AAV vectors can cause the body
to produce NAbs after as little as one treatment, the pool of available trial participants may also be reduced if AAV vectors are increasingly used to treat heart failure or other conditions. Although we are currently exploring whether a plasma
exchange procedure can be used to remove AAV1 neutralizing antibodies from advanced heart failure patients to enable their treatment with MYDICAR, such a procedure may ultimately prove to be unsafe, ineffective or cost prohibitive, and we cannot

predictive of our future clinical trial designs or results. In addition, our CUPID 1 and CUPID 2 trials had a combined enrollment of 301 patients, which is smaller than the number of patients we may need to enroll in a Phase 3 trial for MYDICAR, if
such trial is required by the FDA. Our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is a high failure rate for drugs and biological products proceeding through clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying
interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*The results from our CUPID 2 trial may not be sufficiently robust to support the submission of marketing approval for MYDICAR for the treatment of
systolic heart failure. Before we submit MYDICAR for marketing approval, the FDA and the EMA may require us to conduct additional clinical trials, or evaluate subjects for an additional follow-up period. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ongoing CUPID 2 trial, which is a 250-patient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of MYDICAR to reduce the frequency of, and/or delay of, heart failure-related hospitalizations in persons with systolic heart failure, may not be deemed to be a pivotal trial or may not provide sufficient support for a BLA submission.
Although our CUPID 1 trial met its primary safety and efficacy endpoints at six months for high-dose MYDICAR versus placebo and the safety profile from this trial was very favorable, it is still possible that, even if we achieve favorable results in
the CUPID 2 trial, the FDA may require us to conduct one or more additional clinical trials, possibly involving a larger sample size or a different clinical trial design, particularly if the FDA does not find the results from the CUPID 2 trial to be
sufficiently persuasive to support a BLA submission. For example, the FDA advised us in October 2013 that the number of subjects in our proposed safety database may be an issue to be considered in review of our BLA submission. The FDA may also
require that we conduct a longer follow-up period of subjects treated with our MYDICAR product candidate prior to accepting our BLA submission. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 1998, the FDA published &#147; <I>Guidance for Industry &#151; Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and
Biological Products&#148;</I> outlining the conditions in which a single trial might be sufficient to support a BLA submission. We believe that the FDA may not require us to complete additional trials of MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart
failure if the results of our CUPID 2 trial meet the requirements for a single trial set forth in this guidance. In addition, in November 2013, the EMA indicated that if MYDICAR demonstrates a substantial and highly significant treatment effect in
the advanced heart failure population, and no untoward effects attributable to MYDICAR are observed, a safety database of approximately 205 to 230 MYDICAR-treated subjects may be sufficient to assess safety and allow acceptance of an MMA for MYDICAR
for the treatment of systolic heart failure. We therefore believe that, if the above conditions are met, a Phase 3 trial will not be required for marketing approval in Europe. It is possible, however, that the FDA or the EMA may not consider the
results of our CUPID 2 trial to be sufficient for approval of MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure. If the FDA or the EMA requires additional studies, including Phase 3 trials, we would incur increased costs and delays in the
marketing approval process, which would require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and the EMA may have divergent opinions on the elements necessary for a successful BLA and MAA,
respectively, which may cause us to alter our development, regulatory and/or commercialization strategies. </P>

prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with MYDICAR may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or
events. Although extensive preclinical safety and biodistribution testing conducted on MYDICAR and other AAV vectors, including the CUPID 1 trial of MYDICAR for systolic heart failure and data from previous clinical trials of other AAV vectors,
suggests that MYDICAR will be well tolerated, known adverse side effects that could present with treatment with AAV vectors include an immunologic reaction to the capsid protein or gene at early timepoints after administration. In previous clinical
trials involving AAV viral vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced serious adverse events, including the development of an immunologic T-cell response against the vector capsid proteins. If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect, or
other adverse events, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, theoretical adverse side effects of AAV vectors include replication and spread of the virus to other parts of the body and
insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the insertion of a gene near a gene that is important in cell growth or division results in uncontrolled cell division, also known as cancer, which could potentially enhance the risk of malignant
transformation. Potential procedure-related events are similar to those associated with standard coronary intervention procedures, and may include vascular injury (e.g., damage to the femoral, radial, or brachial arteries at the site of vascular
access, or damage to the coronary arteries) or myocardial injury. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further
development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product
liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we complete the
necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate or the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we expect. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot commercialize a product until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate and, if
applicable, its companion diagnostic, as is the case with MYDICAR. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not
be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon
additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a
treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable
for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will
remain subject to regulatory scrutiny. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, regulatory authorities may still
impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the holder of an approved BLA is
obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA. The holder of an approved BLA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the
approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by
the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, and adherence to commitments made in the BLA. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events
of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of
the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following

specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which
greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our
product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation,
unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product
candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we obtain and maintain approval for MYDICAR from the FDA, we may never obtain approval for MYDICAR outside of the United

does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of MYDICAR outside of
the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must
also approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates in those countries and, if applicable, any required companion diagnostic. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review
periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be
approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products, if approved, is also subject to approval. While we may decide to submit an MAA to the EMA for approval in the EEA, obtaining such approval is a
lengthy and expensive process and the EMA has its own procedures for approval of product candidates. Even if a product is approved, the FDA or the EMA, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require
extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and the EEA also have requirements for
approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us
and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not
ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may
be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of MYDICAR will be
harmed and our business will be adversely affected. </P>

this agreement does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2012, we obtained an SPA from the FDA for
a potential Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of MYDICAR. The FDA&#146;s SPA process creates a written agreement between the sponsoring company and the FDA regarding clinical trial design and other clinical trial issues, such as the trial endpoints,
that can be used to support approval of a product candidate. The SPA is intended to provide assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed and the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, the data may serve as the primary
basis for an efficacy claim in support of a BLA. However, an SPA is not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, an SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if previously
unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, if other new scientific concerns regarding product candidate safety or efficacy arise or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical
trial protocols. Moreover, an SPA does not address all of the variables and details that may go into planning for or conducting a clinical trial, and any change in the protocol for a clinical trial can invalidate an SPA or require the sponsor to
submit an amendment. Although our SPA with the FDA provides that the primary efficacy endpoint of time-to-recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence of terminal events (all-cause death, heart transplant and LVAD implantation)
is acceptable for a potential Phase 3 pivotal trial of MYDICAR, the SPA specifically provides that the FDA&#146;s agreement to this point assumes certain elements, including the acceptance of certain simulation models by the FDA and the validation
by the FDA of the software used to implement the statistical model. In June 2013, the FDA advised us that it had concerns regarding the simulation results that we had submitted in favor of the trial model. Later in June 2013, we responded to the FDA
and provided it with software for data simulations and analysis supporting our proposed statistical model, however, the FDA may not agree with the sufficiency of our simulation models and software used to implement such models and may request that
we use an alternative statistical model. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notably, CUPID 2 is substantially similar in design to the SPA Phase 3 protocol and uses the
same primary efficacy endpoint. However, while we believe that the FDA&#146;s agreement in the SPA regarding the trial endpoints will support approval if the CUPID 2 trial is deemed a pivotal trial for purposes of BLA submission, the SPA does not
directly apply to the CUPID 2 trial. There can also be no assurance that the FDA will ultimately consider our SPA to be binding, particularly on the CUPID 2 trial that we are conducting. The FDA could assert that additional data, including data
obtained through one or more additional clinical trials, may be required to support a regulatory submission. In addition, while an SPA addresses the requirements for submission of a BLA, the results of the related clinical trial may not support FDA
approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties </B></P>

suppliers, including Lonza, would need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, the satisfaction of which may not be met on a timely basis. </P>

significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. We source key materials from third parties, either directly through agreements with suppliers or indirectly through our manufacturers who have agreements with suppliers.
There are a small number of suppliers for certain key materials that are used to manufacture our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Such suppliers may not sell these key materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on
commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these key materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these key
materials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our

organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved, including
MYDICAR, we must build our sales, distribution, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale or distribution of
pharmaceutical or diagnostic products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain, and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide
adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely
impact the commercialization of these products. We may enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates or companion diagnostic outside of the United States, including for MYDICAR. We intend to build an
internal sales force for the commercialization of MYDICAR in the United States. However, we will also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for our product candidates and companion diagnostic in the United States and other
geographies where we obtain marketing approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy for MYDICAR is to develop a hospital-directed sales force and/or collaborate
with third parties to promote the product to selected cardiologists, heart failure specialists and third-party payors, which number in the thousands in the United States. Some pharmaceutical companies employ groups of sales representatives of much
larger scale than we intend to utilize to target their cardiovascular products for the general physician community and third-party payors. We may in the future, choose to align ourselves with collaborators as part of our commercialization strategy,
particularly outside of the United States, and our future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or companion diagnostic or may otherwise fail in their
commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our product candidates and companion diagnostic to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions, including the
United States, that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates or companion diagnostic, our ability to generate revenues from
product sales, including sales of MYDICAR, will be adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Building an internal sales force involves many challenges,

build our own sales force or negotiate a strategic partnership for the commercialization of MYDICAR or our companion diagnostic in the United States, we may be forced to delay the potential commercialization of MYDICAR, reduce the scope of our sales
or marketing activities for MYDICAR or undertake the commercialization activities for MYDICAR at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital,
which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring MYDICAR to market or generate product revenue. We could enter into arrangements with collaborative partners or
otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be ideal and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or our companion diagnostic or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and
distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded
marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with
third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and
establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or
reposition our sales and marketing personnel. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*If the market size for MYDICAR is considerably smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly
and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is very difficult to estimate the future commercial
potential of MYDICAR due to factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, changing standards of care, third-party payor reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, and the availability of competitive
alternatives that may emerge. We believe that approximately 60% of such potential patients in the United States will be ineligible for treatment with MYDICAR due to the presence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs which will neutralize the effectiveness of
AAV-based vectors such as MYDICAR. In other countries, such as Poland, the prevalence of pre-existing AAV-resistant antibodies is significantly higher. In addition, just one exposure to an AAV-based treatment such as MYDICAR may cause a patient to
produce NAbs. Furthermore, other pharmaceutical companies could develop and receive approval for new AAV-based treatments which could increase the number of patients that exhibit NAbs. We estimate that there are over 350,000 heart failure patients
in the United States alone that will be eligible for MYDICAR therapy; however, if the potential eligible patient population is lower than we anticipate, or if considerably more than 60% of potential patients exhibit NAbs, it could significantly and
negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently exploring whether a plasma exchange procedure can be used to remove AAV1 neutralizing antibodies from advanced heart failure patients to enable their
treatment with MYDICAR, and plan to initiate a pilot, 24 patient, Phase 1/2 study of MYDICAR in advanced heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction and pre-existing levels of neutralizing antibodies against the AAV1 vector, who will undergo
plasma exchange prior to administration of MYDICAR. Initial results from this study are expected in 2015. If we are able to successfully utilize plasma exchange on patients to reduce AAV1 neutralizing antibodies in advance of MYDICAR administration,
we estimate the patient population eligible for MYDICAR treatment could be increased by approximately 175,000 patients. However, if the procedure ultimately proves to be unsafe, ineffective or cost prohibitive, or if our estimates of the potentially
increased patient population is significantly higher than the actual number, or if the procedure is not covered for reimbursement by third-party payors, our results of operations and prospectus would be negatively impacted. </P>

as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for
investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent
protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful
in marketing our product candidates against competitors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of our license agreement with AskBio LLC, or AskBio, we granted
AskBio an option to obtain a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain of our patent rights related to infusion of AAV in the arteries of the heart to develop, manufacture, use and sell products for the treatment of cardiac diseases. This
option includes our currently pending patent application related to a method of treating a cardiovascular disease by infusion of a therapeutic nucleic acid into the coronary circulation over a specified period of time. It does not include our issued
patent in this family, which includes claims to the concurrent use of a vasodilating substance such as nitroglycerin. Although the scope of the license granted to AskBio excludes our issued patent and the scope of our anticipated regulatory
approvals, there can be no guarantee AskBio will not seek to develop and commercialize a product that is able to compete with MYDICAR. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate faster than our competitors, we may face
competition from &#147;biosimilars&#148; due to the changing regulatory environment. In the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are
demonstrated to be &#147;highly similar,&#148; or &#147;biosimilar,&#148; to or &#147;interchangeable&#148; with an FDA-approved biological product. This new pathway could allow competitors to reference data from biological products already approved
after 12 years from the time of approval. In addition, companies may be developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with our products. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products,
our products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of our applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products,
assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent
rights, we could face litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our competitors&#146; products. The availability of our competitors&#146; products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any
products that we may develop and commercialize. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The commercial success of any current or future gene therapy product candidate will depend upon the

legal concerns about gene therapy and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use. Even with the requisite approvals, the commercial success of our gene therapy product
candidates will depend in part on the medical community, patients, and third-party payors accepting gene therapy products in general, and our product candidates in particular, as medically useful, cost-effective, and safe. Any product that we bring
to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may
not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the
benefits of the product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for MYDICAR, our companion diagnostic or any other product
candidates, if approved, on reasonable pricing terms, their commercial success may be severely hindered. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Successful sales of any
approved product candidates depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on
third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be
paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other
third-party payors. In addition, the market for MYDICAR and any of our other product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors&#146; formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and
reimbursement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated
methods of controlling healthcare costs. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ
significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and
reimbursement will be obtained. In many foreign countries, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country, and we may fail to obtain such reimbursement approvals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, decisions about Medicare coverage and reimbursement for new medicines are made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp;
Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for administering the Medicare program. Private payors and other government payors often follow CMS&#146;s policies to a substantial degree,
making the Medicare determinations particularly significant. It remains uncertain what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these
new products. Similarly, outside the United States, we may not succeed in obtaining reimbursement approval from the relevant regulatory authorities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost
alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required CMS to reduce the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee
Schedule, or CLFS, by 2% in 2013, which in turn serves as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, CMS announced that it will bundle the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital
outpatient setting beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">More recently, on April&nbsp;1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of
2014, or PAMA, was signed to law, which, among other things, significantly alters the current payment methodology under the CLFS. Under the new law, starting January&nbsp;1, 2016 and </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
every three years thereafter (or annually in the case of advanced diagnostic lab tests), applicable clinical laboratories must report laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered
clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes during a time period to be defined by future regulations. The reported data must include the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each
test that was paid by each private payor (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations). Beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test
will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period. The payment rate will apply to clinical laboratory diagnostic tests furnished by a hospital laboratory if the test is separately paid under the
hospital outpatient prospective payment system. Additionally, PAMA overrules reforms included in the 2014 final rule for the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that called for a process to permit CMS to adjust payments under the CLFS to account for
technological changes in tools, machines, supplies, labor, instruments, skills, techniques and devices by which laboratory tests are produced and used beginning in 2015. Levels of reimbursement may be impacted by these initiatives and other current
and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors in a manner that may harm the demand and reimbursement available for our products, including our companion diagnostic, which in turn, could harm our product pricing
and sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other
market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices
of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix
their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in
markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party coverage and reimbursement for MYDICAR or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not
be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets and may vary substantially from our current assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*Healthcare reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended
by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which has the potential to substantially change health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under
the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals
enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness
research. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was
enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at
least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to
providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American
Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including physicians, hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations
period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and
state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we have not historically experienced unique difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees, we could experience such
problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. There is
currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical
development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms, or at all, given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In
addition, failure to succeed in preclinical studies or clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may
impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Furthermore, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged
proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>*We will need to expand our organization

commercialize MYDICAR, if approved, using an internal sales force to target selected cardiologists, heart failure specialists and third-party payors in the United States. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention
away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure,
operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects,
such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be
able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. </P>

the NASDAQ Global Market have imposed various requirements on public companies. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted.
There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as &#147;say on pay&#148; and proxy access. Recent
legislation permits smaller &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of their initial public offering. We intend to take advantage of this new
legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level
of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact (in ways we cannot currently anticipate) the manner in which we operate our
business. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities
more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain
our current levels of such coverage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of

risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is undergoing a continued severe
economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot
anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our business

computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors, consultants and potential collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication
and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our
development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or
reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our vectors, our product candidates and our companion diagnostic and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material
adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur
liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates and any related companion diagnostics could be delayed. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidates and companion diagnostic are manufactured and distributed using technically complex processes requiring specialized
facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production risks. While
product batches released for use in clinical trials or for commercialization undergo sample testing, some defects may only be identified following product release. In addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes
may result in these intermediate products not complying with stability requirements or specifications. Most of our product candidates must be stored and transported at temperatures within a certain range. If these environmental conditions deviate,
our product candidates&#146; remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their efficacy and safety could become adversely affected, making them no longer suitable for use. The occurrence or suspected occurrence of production and distribution
difficulties can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays,
substantial expense, lost sales and delays of new product launches. Any interruption in the supply of finished products or the loss thereof could hinder our ability to timely distribute our products and satisfy customer demand. Any unforeseen
failure in the storage of the product or loss in supply could delay our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues and operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Earthquakes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects. A majority of our management operates in our principal executive offices located in San Diego, California. If our San Diego offices were affected by a natural or man-made disaster, particularly those
that are characteristic of the region, such as wildfires and earthquakes, or other business interruption, our ability to manage our domestic and foreign operations could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities
of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity
plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity
plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently rely, and intend to rely in the future, on our third-party manufacturer, Lonza, to produce our
clinical supply of MYDICAR. Our ability to obtain supply of MYDICAR could be disrupted, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the operations of Lonza were affected by a man-made or
natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact of any such events on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure is unknown. For more information regarding our manufacturing services agreement and our

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to
our product candidates and companion diagnostic. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail
to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates and companion diagnostic in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and
patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates or companion
diagnostic, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately
protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or companion diagnostic or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties,
which may have an adverse impact on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our programs,
product candidates and companion diagnostic fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates or companion diagnostic, it could dissuade companies
from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize, future products. Several patent applications covering our product candidates and companion diagnostic have been filed recently. We cannot offer any
assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other
patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates or companion diagnostic that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period
of time during which we could market a product candidate and companion diagnostic under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing,
and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate or companion diagnostic. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference
proceeding in the United States can be initiated by a third party to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United
States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates and
companion diagnostic are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. </P>

confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized
disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse
against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether
to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA&#146;s disclosure policies may

non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our

important to our business and we expect that we may need to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose on us, various development,
regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, payment of milestones and/or royalties and other obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to
terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. Additionally, several of our existing license agreements are sublicenses from a third party who is not the original licensor of the intellectual
property at issue. Under these agreements, we must rely on our licensor to comply with their obligations under the primary license agreements under which such third party obtained rights in the applicable intellectual property, where we may have no
relationship with the original licensor of such rights. If our licensors fail to comply with their obligations under these upstream license agreements, the original third-party licensor may have the right to terminate the original license, which may
terminate our sublicense. If this were to occur, we would no longer have rights to the applicable intellectual property unless we are able to secure our own direct license with the owner of the relevant rights, which we may not be able to do at a
reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, which may impact our ability to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates and companion diagnostic incorporating the relevant intellectual property. See &#147;Business&#151;License

license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In
that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates or companion diagnostic,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a
substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences,
oppositions and <I>inter partes</I> review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by
third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates and our companion diagnostic. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates
and companion diagnostic may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third parties may assert that we
are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of
our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or companion
diagnostic may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by the use of our technologies. If any third-party patents are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover any aspect of the manufacturing process for any of our product
candidates or companion diagnostic, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product candidate or companion diagnostic, including the formulation or method of use of such product candidate or companion diagnostic, the
holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate or companion diagnostic unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. In any such case, such a license
may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Parties making claims against us for infringement of their intellectual
property rights may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates or any related companion diagnostics. Defense of these claims,
regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we could be required to redesign our
infringing products or obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and commercializing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we
are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. It may be impossible to redesign our products and technology, or it may require substantial time and monetary
expenditure, which could force us to cease commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the companion diagnostic, or some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, in any such proceeding, we
may be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees in the event we are found liable for willful infringement. </P>

of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our product candidates and companion diagnostic may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and

parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources
than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates and companion diagnostic. More established
companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, we collaborate with U.S. and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written
agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution&#146;s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such right of first negotiation
for intellectual property, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties,

we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights, our ability to commercialize our products, and our business, financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer. </P>

we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed,
or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. A third-party defendant may also request post grant review or <I>inter partes</I> review by the U.S.
PTO of any patent we assert. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to
our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the
prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.
We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that
some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts
or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The patent protection

our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information,
including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors,
are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor&#146;s discovery of our

data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to
publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising
from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets
under the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties,

party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post
grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or related
companion diagnostics. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our
patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product
candidates and companion diagnostic. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Changes in U.S. patent
law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As is the case with
other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly,
time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection
available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty
with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to
obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the recent case, <I>Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,</I> the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to
DNA molecules are not patentable. While we do not believe that any of the patents owned or licensed by us will be found invalid based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. PTO may
impact the value of our patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our
intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal
and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the
United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have
patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual
property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those
relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign
jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing
and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our
intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P>

executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the

our initial public offering of our common stock. Pursuant to the registration statement, we registered the offer and sale of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock. On February&nbsp;4, 2014, we sold 5,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public
offering price of $8.00 per share and on February&nbsp;27, 2014, we sold 825,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares.
The offering has terminated. The sole book-running managing underwriter for the offering was Barclays Capital Inc. After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs paid by us of $6.3 million, the net proceeds from the offering
were approximately $44.3 million. No offering expenses were paid or are payable, directly or indirectly, to our directors or officers, to persons owning 10% or more of any class of our equity securities, or to any of our affiliates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The net proceeds from our initial public offering have been invested in highly-liquid money market funds and investment grade corporate debt
securities, pending their use. Our cash requirements for the first six months of 2014 were met with sources of liquidity available to us at December&nbsp;31, 2013, prior to our initial public offering. There has been no material change in the
expected use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424(b), except we intend to dedicate all or a portion of the net proceeds received by us from the full
exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares to a trial of MYDICAR for the treatment of AVF maturation failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="tx756307_14">
