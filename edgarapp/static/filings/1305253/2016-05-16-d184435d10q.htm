The Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing to market novel products for the treatment of orphan diseases. The Company has built a diverse portfolio of well-characterized product candidates with the potential to
address diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which an effective therapy is urgently needed. The Company&#146;s principal operations are based in Palo Alto, California and it operates in one
segment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Reverse Merger </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March 22, 2016, Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Eiger&#148;) completed its merger with Celladon Corporation (&#147;Celladon&#148;) in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated November 18, 2015 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), by and among Celladon, Celladon Merger Sub, Inc. (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;) and Eiger (the
&#147;Merger&#148;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Eiger, with Eiger becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celladon and the surviving corporation of the Merger. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement, Eiger stockholders became the majority stockholders of the surviving company. In connection with, and immediately prior to, the closing of the Merger, on March 22, 2016, Celladon filed an amendment to its amended
and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a fifteen-for-one reverse stock split of its common stock (the &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;). In connection with and immediately following
the consummation of the Merger, on March 22, 2016, Celladon filed an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change its name to Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. The
Company&#146;s shares of common stock listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, previously trading through the close of business on Tuesday, March 22, 2016 under the ticker symbol &#147;CLDN,&#148; commenced trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, on a
post-reverse stock split adjusted basis, under the ticker symbol &#147;EIGR&#148; on March 23, 2016. On March 22, 2016, a Certificate of Merger was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the Merger of Merger Sub with
and into Eiger. See Note 4 for further details. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company, or Eiger, as used in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March 22, 2016, and prior to the closing of the Merger, Celladon completed a fifteen-for-one reverse stock split. As a result of the reverse
stock split, every fifteen shares of Celladon common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger were combined and reclassified into one share of Celladon common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock
split. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The holders of shares of Eiger common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger received approximately 0.09 shares of
Celladon common stock in exchange for each share of Eiger common stock in the Merger. Following the reverse stock split and the Merger on March 22, 2016, the combined company had 6,945,401 shares of common stock outstanding. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements

continue to incur losses for the next several years. On March 22, 2016, the Company completed the Merger which provided $28.0 million in net cash (see Note 4). In addition, prior to the closing of the Merger, the Company received $33.5 million in

subsidiaries, EBPI Merger Inc., EB Pharma LLC and Eiger BioPharmaceuticals Europe Limited, and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) and following the
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted.
These financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the Company&#146;s annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a
fair statement of the Company&#146;s financial information. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016 or for any other interim period or for any other future year.
The balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to clinical trial accrued liabilities, valuation of derivatives, common stock, stock-based
compensation and income taxes.&nbsp;The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Accrued Research and Development Costs </I></B></P>

conduct of preclinical and clinical studies, and contract manufacturing activities. The Company records the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced, and
includes these costs in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are a significant component of the
Company&#146;s research and development expenses. The Company accrues for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with its third-party service providers. The Company makes
significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities. </P>

option pricing model and recognized as expense on a straight line-basis over the employee&#146;s or director&#146;s requisite service period (generally the vesting period). Non-cash stock compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected
to vest and is reduced by an estimate for future forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates. </P>

2014-15, <I>Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern</I>. ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate relevant conditions, events and certain management plans that are known or reasonably knowable
that when, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, for both annual and interim periods. ASU 2014-15
also requires certain disclosures around management&#146;s plans and evaluation, as well as the plans, if any, that are intended to mitigate those conditions or events that will alleviate the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal
years ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,&nbsp;<I>Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt

instead of as an asset. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December&nbsp;15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the adoption of this

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fair value accounting is applied for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). At March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the carrying amount of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximated their estimate fair value due to their
relatively short maturities. Management believes the terms of the convertible promissory notes reflect current market conditions for an instrument with similar terms and maturity, therefore the carrying value of the Company&#146;s debt approximated
its fair value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the condensed consolidated balance sheets are
categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 1</I>: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities at the measurement date; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 2</I>: Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the related assets or liabilities; and </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Level 3</I>: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair
value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company did not have any financial instruments that
were measured on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2016. The Company&#146;s financial instruments as of December 31, 2015 included a warrant liability and an obligation to issue common stock in connection with the Eiccose asset purchase agreement,
which were classified as Level 3. See Notes 6 and 7 for further discussion on the obligation to issue common stock and the warrant liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December 31, 2015, in order to determine the fair value of the Company&#146;s warrant liability and the obligation to issue common stock
in connection with the Eiccose asset purchase agreement, the Company engaged an independent third-party valuation expert to determine the fair value of these instruments based on the common stock value which is based on probability weighted
scenarios, each based on an income approach. The income approach estimates enterprise value based on the expectation of future cash flows that the Company will generate over the forecast horizon and a terminal value at the end of the forecast
horizon. These future cash flows and terminal value are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based upon the required rate of return based on the risks associated with the investment. Upon settlement in March 2016, the Company
remeasured the fair value of the Company&#146;s warrant liability and the obligation to issue common stock in connection with the Eiccose asset purchase agreement based on the fair value of the common stock that was issued upon settlement of these
instruments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the periods presented. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March 22, 2016, Eiger completed the Merger with Celladon as discussed in Note 1.&nbsp;For accounting purposes, Eiger is
considered to be acquiring Celladon in the Merger. Eiger was determined to be the accounting acquirer based upon the terms of the Merger and other factors including; (i) Eiger security holders own approximately 78% of the combined company
immediately following the closing of the Merger, (ii) Eiger directors hold all of the board seats in the combined company, and (iii) Eiger management holds a majority of key positions in the management of the combined company. The Merger will be
accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than business combination because the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Eiger do not meet the definition of a business as defined by U.S. GAAP. The net assets acquired in connection with this
transaction were recorded at their estimated acquisition date fair values as of March 22, 2015, the date the Merger with Celladon was completed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger and in connection with the private placement, the principal outstanding convertible
promissory notes (&#147;Promissory Notes&#148; or &#147;Notes&#148;) of Eiger converted into shares of common stock of Eiger. Further, all outstanding warrants issued in connection with the Promissory Notes were exercised for common stock (see Note
7) and all shares of preferred stock of Eiger converted into shares of common stock of Eiger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the effective date of the Merger,
Celladon issued shares of its common stock to Eiger stockholders, at an exchange rate of approximately 0.09 shares of common stock, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, in exchange for each share of Eiger common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger. The exchange rate was calculated by a formula that was determined through arms-length negotiations between Celladon and Eiger. The combined Company assumed all of the outstanding options, whether or not vested, under
the Eiger 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;Eiger Plan&#148;) with such options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of Celladon common stock equal to 0.09 multiplied by the number of shares of Eiger common stock
previously represented by such options. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Immediately after the Reverse Stock Split and the Merger on March 22, 2016, there were 6,945,401
shares of the combined Company&#146;s common stock outstanding. In addition, immediately after the Merger, pre-Merger Eiger stockholders, warrantholders and optionholders owned approximately 78% of the aggregate number of shares of the combined
Company&#146;s common stock, and the stockholders of Celladon immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 22% of the aggregate number of shares of the combined Company&#146;s common stock (on a fully diluted basis). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the Merger closing date of March 22, 2016, Celladon had 1.6 million shares of common stock outstanding and a market capitalization of $27.5
million. The estimated fair value of the net assets of Celladon on March 22, 2016 was $27.3 million. The fair value of Celladon&#146;s common stock on the Merger closing date was above the fair value of Celladon&#146;s net assets. As Celladon&#146;s
net assets are predominantly comprised of cash offset by current liabilities, the fair value of Celladon&#146;s net assets as of March 22, 2016 is considered to be the best indicator of the fair value and, therefore, the estimated preliminary
purchase consideration. </P>

Co., Inc., or Merck, which provides the Company with the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Sarasar/Lonafarnib. As consideration for such exclusive right, the Company issued 27,350 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock with a fair
value of $500,000 when the agreement was executed in September 2010. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay Merck up to an aggregate of $27.0 million in development milestones and will be required to pay tiered royalties based on aggregate
annual net sales of all licensed products ranging from mid-single to low double-digit royalties on net sales. The Company&#146;s obligation to pay royalties to Merck expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of either
the expiration of the last to expire patent assigned to the Company under the agreement, which is estimated to be in December 2016 or the earliest of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product. In May 2015, the first

Glenn, a director of the Company, is the sole owner of EGI. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company purchased all of the assets related to the use of farnesyl transferase inhibitors as anti-viral agents and methods to treat viral infections with
those inhibitors and inhibitors of prenylation, prenyl cysteine methyltranferase and a protease that removes the XXX tripeptide from the CXXX polypeptide following prenylation including any related intellectual property to EGI. The Company paid EGI
an upfront payment of $350,000 when the agreement was executed in December 2010. Additionally, the Company will not pay royalties until it has recouped the development costs of any drug product that incorporates clemizole. Once the costs have been
recouped, the Company will pay a low single digit royalty of future aggregate annual net sales if there is no generic competition for the product and a lower single digit royalty of future aggregate annual net sales if there is generic competition
for the product. Within the first ten years after commercialization, the Company may make a one-time payment of $500,000 for each contract for the three types of product related to such intellectual property that would reduce the payment term for
the three products to the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale. The obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of either when the product is no longer sold in any country or the
earliest of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product. As of March 31, 2016, the product has not achieved regulatory approval. </P>

would be automatically exercised if the Company consummated a public offering (&#147;PO&#148;) including a reverse merger. If the PO or reverse merger did not occur by February 28, 2016, the warrant coverage amount was equal to 17.5% of the
outstanding principal balance of the Notes. The number of warrant shares into which the warrants could be exercised was equal to the warrant coverage amount divided by the per share price of the equity securities sold in a qualified financing for an
exercise price of $0.12 per share. The warrants also include a provision whereby in the event of a PO or reverse merger which would result in the automatic exercise of the warrants and the automatic conversion of the Notes, the exercise price of the
warrants would be paid by cancelling any unpaid interest on the Notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November 18, 2015, the Company entered into a Subscription

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2015, three putative securities class action complaints (captioned Fialkov v. Celladon Corporation, Case
No.&nbsp;15-cv-1458-AJB-DHB, Lorusso v. Celladon Corporation, Case No.&nbsp;15-cv-1501-L-JLB and Jacobs v. Celladon Corporation, Case No.&nbsp;15-cv-1529-AJB-MDD) were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against
Celladon and certain of Celladon&#146;s current and former officers. The complaints generally allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, by making materially
false and misleading statements regarding the clinical trial program for MYDICAR, thereby artificially inflating the price of Celladon&#146;s common stock. The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief, including attorneys&#146;
fees. On September&nbsp;1, 2015, six stockholders (or groups of stockholders) filed motions to consolidate the three putative securities class actions and to appoint lead plaintiffs (the &#147;Motions to Consolidate&#148;). A hearing on the Motions
to Consolidate was held on December&nbsp;3, 2015. On December&nbsp;9, 2015, the Court consolidated the three putative securities class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff to represent the putative class. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated
amended complaint on February&nbsp;29, 2016. On April 29, 2016, the defendants, including Eiger, filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amendment complaint. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend these
lawsuits vigorously. Due to the early stage of these proceedings, the Company is not able to predict or reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome or possible losses relating to these claims. </P>

company focused on bringing to market novel product candidates for the treatment of orphan diseases. Since our founding in 2008, we have worked with investigators at Stanford University and evaluated a number of potential development candidates from
pharmaceutical companies to comprise a pipeline of novel product candidates. Our resulting pipeline includes four Phase 2 candidates addressing four distinct orphan diseases. The programs have several aspects in common: the disease targets represent
conditions of high medical need which are inadequately treated by current standard of care; the therapeutic approaches are supported by an understanding of disease biology and mechanism as elucidated by our academic research relationships; prior
clinical experience with the product candidates guides an understanding of safety; and the development paths leverage the experience and capabilities of our experienced, commercially focused management team. The pipeline includes Sarasar<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (lonafarnib) for HDV, PEG-interferon Lambda-1a (Lambda) for HCV, exendin (9-39) for severe hypoglycemia and Bestatin&#153; (ubenimex) for PAH and lymphedema. We plan to deliver Phase 2 data on
all five programs over the course of the next one to three years beginning in 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not
generated any revenue from product sales. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $9.7 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. As of March 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $39.0 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and
administrative costs associated with our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next

reverse merger (&#147;Merger&#148;) between pre-merger Eiger (&#147;Private Eiger&#148;) and Celladon in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November&nbsp;18, 2015, by and among Private Eiger, Celladon and
Celladon Merger Sub, Inc. Also on March&nbsp;22, 2016, in connection with, and prior to the completion of, the Merger, we effected a fifteen for one reverse stock split of our common stock (the &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;) and changed our name
to &#147;Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Immediately prior to and in connection with the Merger, each share of Private Eiger&#146;s preferred stock
outstanding was converted into shares of Private Eiger&#146;s common stock at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock for each share of preferred stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Celladon issued shares of common stock to Private Eiger stockholders, at an
exchange ratio of 0.09 shares of common stock, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, in exchange for each share of Private Eiger&#146;s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The exchange ratio was calculated by a
formula that was determined through arms-length negotiations between Celladon and Private Eiger. Immediately after the Merger, the former Private Eiger equity holders beneficially owned approximately 78% of post-merger Eiger&#146;s common stock. The
Merger was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Financial Operations Overview </B></P>

clinical trials and pursue regulatory approvals, which will require a significant investment in regulatory support and contract manufacturing and inventory build-up related costs. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire or
in-license other product candidates and technologies, which may result in higher research and development expenses due to license fee and/or milestone payments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. We may never succeed in timely developing and
achieving regulatory approval for our product candidates. The probability of success of our product candidates may be affected by numerous factors, including clinical data, competition, intellectual property rights, manufacturing capability and
commercial viability. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.

Allocated expenses consist of facilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation expense and other supplies. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we incurred
incremental expenses as a result of the Merger and incremental expenses as a result of becoming a public company following completion of the Merger, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other expense, net consists of the change in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to Eiccose and the change in fair value of warrant liability.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The change in fair value of the obligation to issue common stock to Eiccose was related to our obligation to issue shares to Eiccose upon the closing of
the next round of financing that resulted in at least $25.0 million in gross proceeds to us.&nbsp;Upon the closing of the private placement on March 22, 2016, we issued to Eiccose 96,300 fully vested shares of our common stock in settlement of this
obligation. In connection with this transaction we remeasured the fair value of the obligation to issue common stock at the settlement date and the change in fair value of $204,000 was recognized within other income (expense), net during the three
months ended March 31, 2016. Upon the settlement of the obligation with the issuance of shares on March 22, 2016, the liability was reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital within stockholders&#146; equity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with our issuance of convertible promissory notes in November 2015, we issued warrants to the noteholders to purchase shares of our common stock
at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The number of shares into which the warrants could be exercised was equal to the warrant coverage amount divided by the per share price of the equity securities sold in a qualified financing and thus was
accounted for as a liability.&nbsp;Upon the closing of the private placement on March 22, 2016, the number of shares of common stock under the warrants was fixed and the fair value remeasured at that date, then the warrants were automatically
exercised for cash into common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a loss related to the change in fair value of the warrant liability of $165,000. The warrant liability was reclassified to common stock and additional
paid-in capital within stockholders&#146; equity, upon the exercise of the warrants and issuance of shares on March 22, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These
estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these
estimates. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management&#146;s judgments and estimates. </P>

accrued expenses for estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by external service providers, which include the conduct of clinical and contract formulation and manufacturing activities. We record the estimated costs of
development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced, and include these costs in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and within development expense in the consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive loss. These costs are a significant component our research and development expenses. We record accrued expenses for these costs based on the estimated amount of work completed and in accordance with agreements
established with these external service providers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the amount of work completed through discussions with internal personnel and external
service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual
costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. </P>

been significant. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have an ongoing agreement for the manufacturing of one of our product candidates denominated in yen. We do

Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of March&nbsp;31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as a result of the material weakness described below. </P>

financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, we identified control deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting that aggregated to a material weakness. A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. The material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting related to a lack of sufficient number of qualified personnel within our accounting function to adequately segregate duties, perform sufficient
review and approval of manual journal entries posted to the general ledger, establish defined accounting policies and procedures or perform timely reviews of account reconciliations or accounting estimates. We have taken certain actions to remediate
this material weakness, including adding additional accounting personnel for review of account reconciliations and manual journal entries. We intend to implement further segregation of duties and to establish formal written policies for our
accounting function by the end of 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Changes in Internal Control </B></P>

procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We have incurred losses since our inception, have a limited operating history on which to assess our business, and anticipate that we will continue to
incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical development-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating
history. We have incurred net losses in each year since the incorporation of our predecessor, Celladon in 2000. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net loss of $9.7 million and $0.8 million respectively. As of March 31,
2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $39.0 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders&#146; equity and working capital. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Accordingly, we
will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. Failure
to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop our product candidates, including conducting clinical studies
and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future
expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or grants. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We expect
losses to increase as we advance four clinical candidates into Phase 2 development for potentially four indications. While we have not yet commenced pivotal clinical studies for any product candidate and it may be several years, if ever, before we
complete pivotal clinical studies and have a product candidate approved for commercialization, we expect to invest significant funds into these clinical candidates to determine the potential to advance these compounds to regulatory approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenue will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates
may receive approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, pricing, reimbursement from third-party payors, and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets. Even if we obtain adequate market share for our
product candidates, because the potential markets in which our product candidates may ultimately receive regulatory approval could be very small, we may never become profitable despite obtaining such market share and acceptance of our products. </P>

candidates have produced results in academic settings to date or for other indications than those that we contemplate and we cannot give any assurance that we will generate data for any of our product candidates sufficient to receive regulatory
approval in our planned indications, which will be required before they can be commercialized. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have invested substantially all of our
efforts and financial resources to identify, acquire, and develop our portfolio of product candidates. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully further develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize one or more of
these product candidates. We currently generate no revenue from sales of any drugs, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a product candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently have four product candidates in or ready for four Phase 1/2 or Phase 2 clinical studies. One of our product candidates, exendin (9-39), has only
generated data in an academic setting and we may not be able to replicate or develop additional data to satisfy regulatory requirements for approval. For ubenimex, data to date has been developed for use in indications other than those that we have
rights to or in which we plan to develop the product candidate. For our recently acquired pegylated interferon lamba, we are in the process of completing the technology transfer from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, in order to undertake
development of this product candidate. There can be no assurance that the data that we develop for our product candidates in our planned indications will be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, none of our product candidates have advanced into a pivotal study for our proposed indications and it may be years before such study is initiated
and completed, if at all. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for
any of our product candidates. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical studies or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are
successful in clinical studies. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our business strategy is based upon obtaining orphan drug designation for our product candidates, which is
an uncertain process. The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable. If we are unable to obtain orphan drug designation or regulatory approval for our
product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our approach to identifying and developing product candidates depends, in large
part, on our ability to obtain orphan drug designation from regulatory authorities in major markets. Without the protection of this regulatory exclusivity, many of our product candidates would otherwise not justify investment as they are not
protected by patents or they are otherwise marketed or generic products. While we assess the potential for obtaining orphan drug designation at the time that we contemplate the acquisition of product candidates and we intend to timely file for such
designation, there can be no assurance that we will obtain orphan drug designation or be able to successfully meet the regulatory requirements to maintain that designation with the planned clinical trials for our product candidates. Failure to
obtain orphan drug designation would make our product candidates significantly less competitive and potentially not viable investments for further development. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of
clinical studies, and depends upon numerous factors. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate&#146;s clinical development and
may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates
or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Applications for our product candidates could fail

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The lengthy and uncertain regulatory approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical
studies, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, although we have obtained orphan drug
designation for two of our product candidates in our planned indications to date, there can be no assurance that the FDA will grant our similar status for our other proposed development indications or other product candidates in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future
study results. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical testing is expensive and generally takes many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can
occur at any time during the clinical study process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of larger, later-stage controlled clinical studies. Product candidates
that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical studies. Our clinical studies to date have been conducted on a small number of patients in limited numbers of clinical
sites and in academic settings or for other indications. We will have to conduct larger, well-controlled studies in our proposed indications to verify the results obtained to date and to support any regulatory submissions for further clinical
development. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles despite promising results in earlier, smaller clinical studies.
Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3, or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety with respect to
the proposed indication for use sufficient to obtain regulatory approval to receive regulatory approval or market our drug candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may find
it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical studies given the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which our product candidates are being studied. Difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical studies of our
product candidates. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is essential to our success.
The timing of our clinical studies depends in part on the rate at which we can recruit patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates, and we may experience delays in our clinical studies if we encounter difficulties in
enrollment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria of our planned clinical studies may further limit the available eligible study participants as we expect to require
that patients have specific characteristics that we can measure or meet the criteria to assure their conditions are appropriate for inclusion in our clinical studies. We may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of
patients to complete our clinical studies in a timely manner because of the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, the availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical studies, and the willingness of
physicians to participate in our planned clinical studies. If patients are unwilling to participate in our clinical studies for any reason, the timeline for conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates may be
delayed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical study of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our
product candidates could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from any of these product candidates could be delayed or prevented. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical studies would likely increase our overall costs,
impair product candidate development and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval relative to our current plans. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and prospects significantly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical studies are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable

the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply all applicable laws, regulations and
guidelines, including those required by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. If we or any of our CROs or vendors fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and
guidelines, the results generated in our clinical studies may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional studies before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure
you that our CROs and other vendors will meet these requirements, or that upon inspection by any regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that efforts, including any of our clinical studies, comply with applicable requirements.
Our failure to comply with these laws, regulations and guidelines may require us to repeat clinical studies, which would be costly and delay the regulatory approval process. </P>

our clinical studies. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, our clinical studies may be delayed or terminated and we may not be able to meet our current plans with respect to our

our product candidates for our clinical studies and regulatory approval. There are expected to be a limited number of suppliers for the active ingredients and other materials that we expect to use to manufacture our product candidates, and we may
not be able to identify alternative suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of our product candidates for our clinical studies, and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. Although we generally do not expect to begin a
clinical study unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the study, any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of a product candidate, or the active ingredient or other material components in the

required to undertake further manufacturing of this product for ourselves. Moreover, even if we have a longer term supply arrangement from these licensors, we may be precluded from entering into a back-up or alternative supplier arrangement which
may increase the risk for further development, regulatory approval, or commercialization of our product candidates. For example, our current agreement with Nippon Kayaku provides for such party to be our exclusive supplier for our ubenimex product

manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and absence of contamination. These problems include
difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign
regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the
contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource
constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product
candidates to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs
and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. </P>

approval of a product candidate, our business may suffer. Because the patient populations in the market for our product candidates may be small, we must be able to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share to achieve
profitability and growth. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We focus our product development principally on treatments for orphan diseases. Given the small number of patients who
have the diseases that we are targeting, our eligible patient population and pricing estimates may differ significantly from the actual market addressable by our product candidate. Our projections of both the number of people who have these
diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources,
including the scientific literature, patient foundations, or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower
than expected. For example, for lonafarnib and lambda, HDV is related to hepatitis B virus, and there is limited scientific literature in support of a causal link between these two viruses. Although we believe that the data are supportive of the
increased severity of hepatitis in the presence of hepatitis D with hepatitis B virus, there can be no assurance that our clinical trials will successfully address this recently observed condition. Likewise, the potentially addressable patient
population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results
of operations and our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop

the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in
selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a
result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring, or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are
more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization, and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our

will be paid for or reimbursed by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or government authorities, private health insurers, and other third-party payors. If coverage and reimbursement are
not available, or are available only in limited amounts, we may have to subsidize or provide products for free or we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products. In the United States, the
principal decisions about coverage and reimbursement for new drugs are typically made by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what
extent a new drug will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow the coverage reimbursement policies established by CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to
reimbursement for products such as ours and what reimbursement codes our products may receive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside the United States, international operations are
generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other price-restrictive regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure
on the pricing and usage of products. In many countries, the prices of products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that
we are able to charge for our products. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the potential revenue may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to limit or
reduce healthcare costs may result in restrictions on coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection
with products due to the increasing trend toward managed healthcare, including the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly
prescription drugs has and is expected to continue to increase in the future. As a result, profitability of our products may be more difficult to achieve even if they receive regulatory approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We intend to rely on a combination of exclusivity from orphan drug designation as well as patent rights for our product candidates and any future
product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain exclusivity from the combination of these approaches, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business strategy is to focus on product candidates for which orphan drug designation may be obtained in the major markets of the world. In addition, we
rely or will rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies and product candidates. For example, the portfolio of patents licensed from
Merck expires before the anticipated launch date of the lonafarnib product candidate. Our success depends in large part on our and our licensors&#146; ability to obtain regulatory exclusivity and maintain patent and other intellectual property
protection in the United States and in other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may
designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there
is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote
the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is
granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be
sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product or where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to
those affected by the condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant
funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan drug designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity,
which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan
exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market
exclusivity following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify
maintenance of market exclusivity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the extent and scope of patent protection for our products may in some cases be limited, orphan drug
designation is especially important for our products for which orphan drug designation may be available. For eligible drugs, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain
orphan drug exclusivity for our drug products and biologic products that do not have broad patent protection, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition sooner than if we had obtained orphan drug exclusivity and our
revenue will be reduced. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even though we have orphan drug designation for lonafarnib in the United States and Europe, we may not be the first to obtain

effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA or
EMA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA or EMA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither
shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a product candidate nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product candidates that are
important to our business. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to
identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent position of
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which legal principles remain unsolved. The patent applications that we own or in-licenses may fail to result in issued
patents with claims that cover our product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can
invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue, and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability, or
scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, found unenforceable or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for
our product candidates, or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We, independently or together with our licensors, have filed several patent applications covering various aspects of our product candidates. We cannot offer
any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any
other patents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the
period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we have licensed a number of patents
covering methods of use and certain compositions of matter, we do not have complete patent protection for our product candidates. For example, the patent coverage for lonafarnib expires before the anticipated launch date. Likewise, most of the
patents covering products that we have licensed in from Stanford have limited protection outside of the United States. Therefore, a competitor could develop the same or similar product that may compete with our product candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of our product licenses are limited to specified indications or therapeutic areas which may result in the same compound being developed and
commercialized by a third party whom we have no control over or rights against. This may result in safety data, pricing or off label uses from that third party&#146;s product that may negatively affect the development and commercialization of our
product candidates. For example, Kura has an exclusive license to tipifarnib for use in cancer indications while we have a license for anti-viral indications. As a result of Kura&#146;s right to use the same compound in a different indication, it is
possible that development and sales may impact our product development and commercialization efforts. If we cannot obtain and maintain effective protection of exclusivity from our regulatory efforts and intellectual property rights, including patent
protection, for our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and results of operations would be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We

States any patent term can be adjusted based on certain delays caused by the applicant(s) or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. For example, a patent term can be reduced based on certain delays caused by the patent applicant
during patent prosecution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States and under supplementary protection certificates in
Europe may be available to extend the patent or data exclusivity terms of products. With respect to ubenimex, lonafarnib, lambda and exendin (9-39), a substantial portion of the potential commercial opportunity will likely rely on patent term
extensions, and we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extensions will be obtained and, if so, for how long. As a result, we may not be able to maintain exclusivity for our products for an extended period after regulatory
approval, which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. If we do not have sufficient patent terms or regulatory exclusivity to protect our products, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. </P>

may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific
literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. We therefore cannot be certain that it or
our licensors were the first to make the invention claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending applications, or that we or our licensor were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for
patentability are met, in the United States prior to March 15, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. After March
15, 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, enacted on September 16, 2011, the United States has moved to a first to file system. The Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way
patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO must still implement various regulations, the courts have yet to address any of these provisions and the
applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed. In general, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding
the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </P>

know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our
employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and
other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO and
corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications
with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. We have conducted freedom to operate analyses with respect to only certain of our product
candidates, and therefore we do not know whether there are any third-party patents that would impair our ability to commercialize these product candidates. We also cannot guarantee that any of our analyses are complete and thorough, nor can we be
sure that we have identified each and every patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant or necessary to the commercialization of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue,
there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, third
parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, the manufacturing process
of any of our product candidates, methods of use, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we
obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and
commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a
successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from
third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be successful in meeting our diligence

from third parties and under patents that we do not own, to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part
on our ability to maintain in effect these proprietary rights. For example, we have certain specified diligence obligations under our Stanford license agreements for our ubenimex and lonafarnib product candidates. We may not be able to achieve the
required diligence milestones in a timely manner, which may result in a right of termination by Stanford, and we may be unable to successfully negotiate an extension or waiver of those termination rights. Any termination of license agreements with

also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical
development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Even if we are able to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that

approved innovator product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, a manufacturer may also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2) that references the FDA&#146;s finding of safety and effectiveness of a previously approved drug. A 505(b)(2) NDA product may be
for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. Innovative small molecule drugs may be eligible for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity (e.g., five years for new chemical entities, three years for changes to an approved drug
requiring a new clinical study, seven years for orphan drugs), which preclude FDA approval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and review of) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA relying on the FDA&#146;s finding of safety and effectiveness for the innovative
drug. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication,
&#147;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; known as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; If there are patents listed in the Orange Book, a generic applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents
must include in the ANDA or 505(b)(2) what is known as a &#147;Paragraph IV certification,&#148; challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must be given
to the innovator, too, and if within 45 days of receiving notice the innovator sues to protect its patents, approval of the ANDA is stayed for 30 months, or as lengthened or shortened by the court. </P>

to include a certification as to each listed patent indicating whether the ANDA applicant does or does not intend to challenge the patent. We cannot predict whether any patents issuing from our pending patent applications will be eligible for

licensors. Although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation, if we or one of our licensing partners were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates,
the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds
for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected
with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with

the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other
employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from
third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, because of the substantial

competitors. Although we have written agreements and make every effort to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or intellectual property rights of others in their work forums, and
we are not currently subject to any claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties, we may in the future be subject to such claims. Litigation may be
necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are
successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual
property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. Likewise, certain of our license agreements, for example for ubenimex, do not include patents or patent applications outside of the
United States as our licensor elected not to file in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Competitors
may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in
the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of
certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult
for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in
substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties
to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the
world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to our

financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the subject company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our lack of sufficient accounting personnel resulted in the identification of a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, the material weakness that was identified related to a lack of sufficient accounting resources and personnel that had limited our ability to adequately segregate duties, perform sufficient
review and approval of manual journal entries posted to the general ledger, establish defined accounting policies and procedures or perform timely reviews of account reconciliations or accounting estimates. Following the Merger, no former employees
of Celladon remain employed by us and Celladon did not have similar issues or report a material weakness or significant deficiency. Consequently, following the Merger we will need to build out and maintain our own public company financial reporting
functions and other resources. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To address the deficiency in our team&#146;s accounting processes, we have begun hiring additional accounting personnel,
and establishing and documenting accounting policies and procedures and implementing management review controls. In particular, we intend to implement further segregation of duties and to establish formal written policies for our accounting function
by the end of 2016. While we intend to implement a plan to remediate this deficiency, we cannot predict the success of such plan or the outcome of our assessment of these plans at this time. We can give no assurance that this implementation will
remediate this deficiency in internal control or that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, although we are not currently
required to formally test our internal controls for attestation, we are required as an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; to report on our internal controls. After we are no longer an emerging growth company, any testing by us conducted in
connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material
weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in
our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our future success depends in part

Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants, and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of highly qualified personnel in our
industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in development and commercialization of our product candidates may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability
to recruit and retain qualified personnel, or the loss of the services of Mr. Cory may impede the progress of our research, development, and commercialization objectives and would negatively impact our ability to succeed in our in-licensing

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reform Law, was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private
insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Health Care Reform Law, among other things, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs
that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care

research and development activities and the subsequent declines of the price of its common stock, three putative class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against Celladon and certain of its current
and former officers. The complaints generally allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, by making materially false and misleading statements regarding the
clinical trial program for MYDICAR, thereby artificially inflating the price of Celladon&#146;s common stock. The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief, including attorneys&#146; fees. On September 1, 2015, six stockholders
(or groups of stockholders) filed motions to consolidate the three putative securities class actions and to appoint lead plaintiffs (the &#147;Motions to Consolidate&#148;). A hearing on the Motions to Consolidate was held on December 3, 2015. On
December 9, 2015, the Court consolidated the three putative securities class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff to represent the putative class. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on February 29, 2016. On April 29, 2016,
the defendants, including Eiger, filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amendment complaint. It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations made by stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming us
and/or our former officers and directors as defendants. We believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. Due to the early stage of these proceedings, we are not able to predict or reasonably estimate the
ultimate outcome or possible losses relating to these claims. While we and Celladon&#146;s former directors&#146; and officers&#146; have a separate liability insurance policy dedicated to any claims that may arise from pre-merger events, there is
no assurance that the coverage will be sufficient. In addition, any such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#146;s attention and resources, which could harm our business. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#146;s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities

governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. These rules and regulations impose significant legal and financial compliance costs and make some
activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, our management team consists of certain executive officers who have not previously managed and operated a public company. These executive officers and other personnel will need to devote
substantial time to gaining expertise regarding operations as a public company and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of
directors or as executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence and could cause our business or stock price to suffer. </P>

and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of the board of directors to issue
preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our voting stock from merging
or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be
considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the
board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are at risk of additional securities class action litigation.

securities, including against Celladon in 2015 which we are continuing to defend. The risk of securities litigation is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If
we face such additional securities litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management&#146;s attention and resources, which could harm our business. </P>

directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of us, even if such a change of control would
benefit our other stockholders. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors&#146; perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. </P>

ownership changes in the future could result in additional limitations on the combined organization&#146;s net operating loss carryforwards. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our net
