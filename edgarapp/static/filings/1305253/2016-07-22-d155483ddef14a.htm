then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in &#147;street name&#148; and the proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered to be the shareholder of record for purposes of
voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent regarding how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the annual meeting. However, since you are not the
shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker or other agent. </P>

combination with privately-held Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Private Eiger&#148;) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of November 18, 2015, by and among Celladon, Celladon Merger
Sub, Inc. or Merger Sub, and Private Eiger (&#147;the Merger Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Eiger, with Private Eiger surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celladon (the &#147;Merger&#148;).
Immediately following the Merger, Celladon changed its name to &#147;Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.&#148; In connection with the closing of the Merger, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol
&#147;EIGR&#148; on March 23, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The former executive officers and a majority of the Board of Directors of Celladon resigned concurrent with the
closing of the Merger. In addition, in April 2016, we dismissed Celladon&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, and appointed the independent registered public accounting firm of Private Eiger, KPMG LLP, as
auditor of the combined company. Throughout this Proxy Statement we discuss both the former executive officers and members of the Board of Directors of Celladon and the current executive officers and members of the Board of Directors of Eiger
BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., the combined company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Merger, the shareholders of Celladon approved a reverse stock split at a ratio of
one new share for every fifteen shares then outstanding (the &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;). All share and per share amounts in this Proxy Statement reflect the Reverse Stock Split unless otherwise noted. On March 22, 2016, upon the completion of
the Merger, the Company issued shares of its common stock to Private Eiger shareholders at an exchange rate of approximately 0.0875 shares of common stock, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, in exchange for each share of Private
Eiger common stock outstanding prior to the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the former Private Eiger shareholders, warrantholders and optionholders owned approximately 78% of the fully-diluted common stock of the Company, with the Celladon
shareholders and optionholders immediately prior to the Merger owning approximately 22% of the fully-diluted common stock of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All references

each of whom is a nominee for director and currently a director of the Company. Based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board nominated each of the nominees for reelection. Each of David A. Cory, Nina
Kjellson, Thomas J. Dietz, Charles Bramlage, Edgar G. Engleman and Jeffrey S. Glenn are currently directors of the Company. If elected at the annual meeting, each of the Class I nominees would serve until the 2019 annual meeting and until his or her
successor has been duly elected and qualified, or, if sooner, until the director&#146;s death, resignation or removal. It is the Company&#146;s policy to invite and encourage directors and nominees for director to attend the Annual Meeting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of
directors. Accordingly, the two nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected. Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the two nominees named
below. If any nominee becomes unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, shares that would have been voted for that nominee will instead will be voted for the election of a substitute nominee proposed by Eiger. Each person
nominated for election has agreed to serve if elected. The Company&#146;s management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As required under the NASDAQ Stock Market (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;) listing standards, a majority of the members of a listed company&#146;s Board of Directors must
qualify as &#147;independent,&#148; as affirmatively determined by the Board of Directors. The Board consults with the Company&#146;s counsel to ensure that the Board&#146;s determinations are consistent with relevant securities and other laws and
regulations regarding the definition of &#147;independent,&#148; including those set forth in pertinent listing standards of NASDAQ, as in effect from time to time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Consistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant identified transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family
members, and the Company, its senior management and its independent auditors, the Board has affirmatively determined that, other than Mr. Cory, by virtue of his position as President and Chief Executive Officer, each of the Company&#146;s directors
is independent within the meaning of the applicable NASDAQ listing standards. In making this determination, the Board found that none of these directors or nominees for director had a material or other disqualifying relationship with the Company.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board of Directors of the Company has an independent chair, Dr. Dietz, who has authority, among other things, to call and preside over Board meetings,
including meetings of the independent directors, to set meeting agendas and to determine materials to be distributed to the Board. Accordingly, the Chairman of the Board has substantial ability to shape the work of the Board. The Company believes
that separation of the positions of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer reinforces the independence of the Board in its oversight of the business and affairs of the Company. In addition, the Company believes that having an independent Chairman
creates an environment that is more conducive to objective evaluation and oversight of management&#146;s performance, increasing management accountability and improving the ability of the Board to monitor whether management&#146;s actions are in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders. As a result, the Company believes that having an independent Chairman can enhance the effectiveness of the Board as a whole. </P>

process. The Board does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through the Board as a whole, as well as through various Board standing committees that address risks inherent in their
respective areas of oversight. In particular, our Board is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, including a determination of the nature and level of risk appropriate for the Company. The Audit Committee has the
responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management
is undertaken. The Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to oversight of the performance of our internal audit function. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee monitors the
effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines, including whether they are successful in preventing illegal or improper liability-creating conduct. The Compensation Committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and
programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. It is the responsibility of the committee chairs to report findings regarding material risk exposures to the Board as quickly as possible. The Board has delegated to the Board&#146;s
lead independent director the responsibility of coordinating between the Board and management with regard to the determination and implementation of responses to any problematic risk management issues. </P>

the Compensation Committee approved the recommendations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Compensation Committee is expected to make most of the significant adjustments to annual
compensation, determine bonus and equity awards and establish new performance objectives at one or more meetings held during the first quarter of the year. However, the Compensation Committee may also consider matters related to individual
compensation, such as compensation for new executive hires, as well as high-level strategic issues, such as the efficacy of the Company&#146;s compensation strategy, potential modifications to that strategy and new trends, plans or approaches to
compensation, at various meetings throughout the year. Generally, the Compensation Committee&#146;s process comprises two related elements: the determination of compensation levels and the establishment of performance objectives for the current
year. For executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee solicits and considers evaluations and recommendations submitted to the Committee by the Chief Executive Officer. In the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the
evaluation of his performance is conducted by the Compensation Committee, which determines any adjustments to his compensation as well as awards to be granted. For all executives and directors as part of its deliberations, the Compensation Committee
may review and consider, as appropriate, materials such as financial reports and projections, operational data, tax and accounting information, tally sheets that set forth the total compensation that may become payable to executives in various
hypothetical scenarios, executive and director stock ownership information, company stock performance data, analyses of historical executive compensation levels and current Company-wide compensation levels and recommendations of the Compensation
Committee&#146;s compensation consultant, including analyses of executive and director compensation paid at other companies identified by the consultant. </P>

Corporate Governance Committee met once during the fiscal year. The Board has adopted a written Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter that is available to shareholders on the
Company&#146;s website at http://ir.eigerbio.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254349&amp;p=irol-govhighlights. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
believes that candidates for director should have certain minimum qualifications, including the ability to read and understand basic financial statements and having the highest personal integrity and ethics. The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee also intends to consider such factors as possessing relevant expertise upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management, having sufficient time to devote to the affairs of the Company, demonstrated excellence in his or her
field, having the ability to exercise sound business judgment and having the commitment to rigorously represent the long-term interests of the Company&#146;s shareholders. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee retains the right
to modify these qualifications from time to time. Candidates for director nominees are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the Board, the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of shareholders. In
conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee typically considers diversity, age, skills and such other factors as it deems appropriate, given the current needs of the Board and the Company, to maintain a balance of
knowledge, experience and capability. In the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews these directors&#146; overall service to the Company during their terms,
including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance and any other relationships and transactions that might impair the directors&#146; independence. In the case of new director candidates, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee also determines whether the nominee is independent for NASDAQ purposes, which determination is based upon applicable NASDAQ listing standards, applicable SEC rules and regulations and the advice of counsel, if
necessary. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then uses its network of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee conducts any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates after considering the function and needs of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets to
discuss and consider the candidates&#146; qualifications and then selects a nominee by majority vote which we expect will typically be recommended to the full board. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates, including the minimum criteria set forth above, based on whether or not the candidate was recommended by a shareholder. Shareholders who wish to recommend individuals
for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to become nominees for election to the Board may do so by delivering a written recommendation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at the following address: c/o

&#147;Amended 2013 ESPP&#148; throughout this proxy statement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Shareholders are requested in this Proposal&nbsp;3 to approve the Amended 2013

votes cast on proposals presented to the shareholders and will have the same effect as negative votes.&nbsp;Broker non-votes are counted towards a quorum, but are not counted for any purpose in determining whether this matter has been approved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reasons to Approve the 2013 ESPP </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2013 ESPP was
originally approved by our Board in September 2013 and our shareholders in October 2013 in connection with our initial public offering, and became effective on June 30, 2014. Initially, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that was
reserved for issuance pursuant to purchase rights under the 2013 ESPP was 165,732 shares. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2013 ESPP would automatically increase on January&nbsp;1 of each year,
beginning on January 1, 2015, and continuing through and including January 1, 2023, by the lesser of (i) 1.00% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, (ii) 384,307 shares or
(iii) a lesser number of shares determined by our Board. As a result, an aggregate of 474,450 new shares were added pursuant to automatic increases that occurred on January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following the Reverse Stock Split that took place in connection with the Merger, 42,677 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2013 ESPP and the number

the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, (ii) 25,620 shares or (iii) such lesser number of shares determined by our Board.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2016, following the Merger, our Compensation Committee approved certain amendments to the 2013 ESPP that did not require the approval of our
shareholders to, among other things: (i) change the name of the 2013 ESPP from the &#147;Celladon Corporation 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan&#148; to the &#147;Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan&#148;; (ii) allow the
Board to provide that persons who initially elected to not participate in an ongoing offering with multiple purchase periods (as defined in the 2013 ESPP) may subsequently be able to elect to participate in such offering prior to the commencement of
the next purchase period; (iii) provide that the accumulated contributions that remain in a participant&#146;s account after the final purchase date (as defined in the 2013 ESPP) of an offering will be distributed in full to the participant; and
(iv) provide that a &#147;corporate transaction&#148; will include any sale or disposition of more than 50% of the Company&#146;s outstanding securities. </P>

ESPP is implemented by offerings of purchase rights to all eligible employees from time to time. The maximum length for an offering under the Amended 2013 ESPP is 27 months. The provisions of separate offerings need not be identical. When an
eligible employee elects to join an offering period, he or she is granted a purchase right to acquire shares of common stock on each purchase date within the offering period. On the purchase date, all payroll deductions collected from the
participant are automatically applied to the purchase of common stock, subject to certain limitations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Eligibility </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, each regular employee (including officers) employed by us (or a parent or subsidiary company if the Board designates such company as eligible to

the required period of continuous employment be greater than two years. In addition, the Board may provide that employees who are customarily employed for less than 20 hours per week or less than five months per calendar year are not eligible to

all outstanding purchase rights and options). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June 30, 2016, approximately 12 of our employees are eligible to participate in the Amended 2013

offering, an agreement authorizing payroll deductions. Currently, such payroll deductions are limited to up to 15% of an employee&#146;s base salary during the offering. Overtime, bonus, commissions and non-cash compensation, such as spread on the
exercise of an option may be excluded. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>$25,000 Limit </I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purchase price of the shares is paid through payroll deductions that accumulate over the course of the offering. To the extent permitted in the offering
document, a participant may increase, reduce or terminate his or her payroll deductions during an offering. All payroll deductions made on behalf of a participant are credited to his or her account under the Amended 2013 ESPP and deposited with our
general funds. To the extent permitted in the offering document, a participant may make additional payments into such account. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Purchase of Stock

employee may be granted the right to purchase and the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be purchased pursuant to such offering by all participants. If the aggregate number of shares to be purchased upon exercise of all
outstanding purchase rights would exceed the number of shares of common stock remaining available under the Amended 2013 ESPP, or the maximum number of shares that may be purchased on a single purchase date across all offerings, our plan
administrator would make a pro rata allocation (based on each participant&#146;s accumulated payroll deductions) of available shares. Unless otherwise specifically provided in the offering, the amount, if any, of accumulated payroll deductions
remaining in any participant&#146;s account after the purchase of shares on the final purchase date of an offering will be distributed in full to the participant at the end of such offering, without interest. Unless the employee&#146;s participation
is discontinued, his or her right to purchase shares is exercised automatically at the end of the purchase period at the applicable price. See &#147;Withdrawal&#148; below. </P>

withdrawal may be elected at any time prior to the end of the applicable offering, except as otherwise provided in the offering. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon any withdrawal from
an offering by the employee, we will distribute to the employee his or her accumulated payroll deductions without interest, less any accumulated deductions previously applied to the purchase of shares of common stock on the employee&#146;s behalf
during such offering, and such employee&#146;s purchase rights in the offering will be automatically terminated. The employee is not entitled to again participate in that offering. However, an employee&#146;s withdrawal from an offering will not

was originally approved by our Board and our shareholders in September 2013 in connection with our initial public offering.&nbsp;The aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to stock awards under the 2013 Plan was
initially 3,043,643 shares, which number was the sum of (1)&nbsp;1,473,738 shares, plus (2)&nbsp;the number of shares (not to exceed 1,569,905 shares) (i) reserved for issuance under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (&#147;2012 Plan&#148;) at the time
our 2013 Plan becomes effective, and (ii)&nbsp;any shares subject to outstanding stock options or other stock awards that were granted under our 2012 Plan or 2001 Stock Option Plan (&#147;2001 Plan&#148;) that are forfeited, terminate, expire or are
otherwise not issued.&nbsp;Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan originally provided for automatic increases on January&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2015, and continuing
through and including January 1, 2023, by 5.00% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by our Board.&nbsp;As a result, an aggregate
of 2,372,254 new shares was added pursuant to automatic increases that occurred on January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2016, in connection with
the Merger, our shareholders approved the Reverse Stock Split. Following the Reverse Stock Split, 258,150 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June 30, 2016, awards (net of shares returned to the 2013 Plan) covering an aggregate of 160,103 shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock have been
granted under the 2013 Plan.&nbsp;None of these awards are currently outstanding.&nbsp;Only 283,623 shares of our common stock (plus any shares that might in the future be returned to the 2013 Plan) remained available for future grant under the 2013
Plan. As of June 30, 2016, the closing price of the Company&#146;s Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $19.82 per share. </P>

industry benchmarks in consultation with Radford, its independent compensation consultant. We believe that such a limit allows us to stay within reasonable bounds of what the market requires in a competitive environment, while also placing

the recipient&#146;s particular situation, each recipient should consult the recipient&#146;s tax adviser regarding the federal, state, local, and other tax consequences of the grant or exercise of an award or the disposition of stock acquired as a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Amended 2013 Plan provides for the grant of stock options that qualify as &#147;incentive stock options,&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;422 of the Code.
Under the Code, an option holder generally is not subject to ordinary income tax upon the grant or exercise of an ISO. If the option holder holds a share received on exercise of an ISO for more than two years from the date the stock option was
granted and more than one year from the date the stock option was exercised, which is referred to as the required holding period, the difference, if any, between the amount realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of that share and the
holder&#146;s tax basis in that share will be long-term capital gain or loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If, however, an option holder disposes of a share acquired on exercise of
an ISO before the end of the required holding period, which is referred to as a disqualifying disposition, the option holder generally will recognize ordinary income in the year of the disqualifying disposition equal to the excess, if any, of the
fair market value of the share on the date the ISO was exercised over the exercise price. However, if the sales proceeds are less than the fair market value of the share on the date of exercise of the stock option, the amount of ordinary income
recognized by the option holder will not exceed the gain, if any, realized on the sale. If the amount realized on a disqualifying disposition exceeds the fair market value of the share on the date of exercise of the stock option, that excess will be
short-term or long-term capital gain, depending on whether the holding period for the share exceeds one year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For purposes of the alternative minimum
tax, the amount by which the fair market value of a share of stock acquired on exercise of an ISO exceeds the exercise price of that stock option generally will be an adjustment included in the option holder&#146;s alternative minimum taxable income
for the year in which the stock option is exercised. If, however, there is a disqualifying disposition of the share in the year in which the stock option is exercised, there will be no adjustment for alternative minimum tax purposes with respect to
that share. In computing alternative minimum taxable income, the tax basis of a share acquired on exercise of an ISO is increased by the amount of the adjustment taken into account with respect to that share for alternative minimum tax purposes in
the year the stock option is exercised. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not allowed an income tax deduction with respect to the grant or exercise of an ISO or the disposition of
a share acquired on exercise of an ISO after the required holding period. If there is a disqualifying disposition of a share, however, we are allowed a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income includible in income by the option holder,
subject to Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code and provided that amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense for us and is reasonable in amount, and either the employee includes that amount in income or we timely satisfy our reporting
requirements with respect to that amount. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Restricted Stock Awards </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, the recipient of a restricted stock award will recognize ordinary income at the time the stock is received equal to the excess, if any, of the fair
market value of the stock received over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the stock. If, however, the stock is not vested when it is received (for example, if the employee is required to work for a period of time in order to have the
right to sell the stock), the recipient generally will not recognize income until the stock becomes vested, at which time the recipient will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock on the date it
becomes vested over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the stock. A recipient may, however, file an election with the Internal Revenue Service, within 30 days following the recipient&#146;s receipt of the stock award, to recognize
ordinary income, as of the date the recipient receives the award, equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock on the date the award is granted over any amount paid by the recipient for the stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The recipient&#146;s basis for the determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of shares acquired from stock awards will be the amount paid
for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized either when the stock is received or when the stock becomes vested. </P>

a stock unit structured to conform to the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code or an exception to Section&nbsp;409A of the Code will recognize ordinary income at the time the stock is delivered equal to the excess, if any, of the fair
market value of the shares of our common stock received over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the shares of our common stock. To conform to the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, the shares of our common stock subject to
a stock unit award may generally only be delivered upon one of the following events: a fixed calendar date (or dates), separation from service, death, disability or a change in control. If delivery occurs on another date, unless the stock units
otherwise comply with or qualify for an exception to the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, in addition to the tax treatment described above, the recipient will owe an additional 20% federal tax and interest on any taxes owed. </P>

appreciation rights are granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date, the recipient will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock or cash received upon such
exercise. Subject to the requirement of reasonableness, the provisions of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, and the satisfaction of a tax reporting obligation, we will generally be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the taxable ordinary income

provide appropriate incentives to Celladon&#146;s executives to achieve defined annual corporate goals and to reward the executives for individual achievement towards these goals. The annual performance-based bonus each named executive officer was
eligible to receive was generally based on the extent to which Celladon achieved the corporate goals that its Board of Directors established each year. At the end of the year, the Celladon Board of Directors and/or its Compensation Committee would
typically review Celladon&#146;s performance against each corporate goal and approve the extent to which Celladon achieved each of its corporate goals. </P>

officers. Celladon&#146;s Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Celladon Board was responsible for approving equity grants to executive officers. Stock option awards were the only form of equity awards Celladon granted to its named
executive officers. Vesting of the stock option awards was tied to continuous service with Celladon and served as an additional retention measure. Celladon&#146;s executives were generally awarded an initial grant upon commencement of employment.
Additional grants occurred periodically in order to specifically incentivize executives with respect to achieving certain corporate goals or to reward executives for exceptional performance. </P>

Mr. Jackson who was appointed as an executive officer of Celladon in January 2015 was awarded an option to purchase 990 shares of common stock. Each of these options was granted effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2015 as an annual refresh grant. Each

which a named executive officer&#146;s service terminates, the named executive officer was entitled to receive amounts earned during his or her term of service, including salary and unused vacation pay. In addition, each of the Celladon named
executive officers was eligible to receive certain benefits pursuant to his or her letter agreements with us described above under &#147;&#151;Agreements with the Named Executive Officers.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the named executive officers&#146; employment letter agreements with Celladon described above, upon the executive&#146;s termination
without &#147;cause,&#148; or resignation for &#147;good reason,&#148; each as defined in the Celladon 2013 plan (as defined below), each of the named executive officers was eligible to receive continued base salary payments and COBRA premium
payments for 12 months for Dr.&nbsp;Zsebo and Mr. Cleveland and nine months for Messrs. Wiklund and Jackson and Mses.&nbsp;Reed and Laba. If the named executive officer&#146;s termination without cause or resignation for good reason were to occur
within the three month period before or 12 month period following a change of control, as defined under the 2013 Plan, the named executive officer would have been eligible to receive (1)&nbsp;continued base salary payments and COBRA premium payments
for 18 months for Dr.&nbsp;Zsebo and Mr. Cleveland and 12 months for Mr. Wiklund and Mses.&nbsp;Reed and Laba, (2)&nbsp;a lump sum payment equal to the named executive officer&#146;s target bonus for the year of termination and (3)&nbsp;full vesting
acceleration of all outstanding equity awards that are subject to time-based vesting. All severance benefits under the letter agreements were contingent upon the named executive officer executing an effective release and waiver of claims against us.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2015, Celladon amended the letter agreements with each of the named executive officers to provide that any cash severance would be paid as a lump sum,

Directors approved modifications to the severance arrangements of Messrs. Cleveland, Wiklund and Jackson and Mses. Reed and Laba, and on October&nbsp;20, 2015, Celladon entered into an amendment to the employment letter agreement of each such
executive officer to memorialize the modified severance arrangements. In connection with Celladon&#146;s process of seeking a merger, sale or other disposition of the company, Celladon&#146;s Board of Directors deemed it advisable, and in the best
interests of Celladon&#146;s shareholders, to incentivize Messrs. Cleveland, Wiklund and Jackson and Mses. Reed and Laba to continue their employment with Celladon for an additional period of time. Accordingly, the modified severance arrangements
for such executive officers provided certainty that, if terminated by Celladon without &#147;cause&#148; or upon a resignation for &#147;good reason,&#148; each executive officer would receive the enhanced severance benefits previously provided for
in the event of such a qualifying termination occurring within three months prior to or twelve months following a change of control transaction (including a liquidation of Celladon). </P>

CUPID 2 results, on April&nbsp;26, 2015, Celladon&#146;s Board of Directors approved a reduction of Celladon&#146;s full-time workforce and committed to retention payments payable to certain key employees, if such employees remained with Celladon
until December&nbsp;31, 2015 or were terminated by Celladon without cause prior to such date (the &#147;Retention Program&#148;). The Retention Program was amended on May&nbsp;13, 2015 to add Messrs. Wiklund and Jackson and Mses. Reed and Laba, and
on May&nbsp;27, 2015, Celladon entered into an agreement with each of the foregoing named executive officers (the &#147;Retention Agreements&#148;) to memorialize the terms of the amended Retention Program. Under the Retention Agreements, each of
Messrs. Wiklund and Jackson and Mses. Reed and Laba was eligible to receive a lump sum retention payment equal to 50% of his or her base salary if such employee remained employed by Celladon until December 31, 2015, or if such employee was
terminated by Celladon without cause prior to such date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Bonus Payments in Lieu of Severance and Retention </I></B></P>

Messrs. Wiklund and Jackson and Ms.&nbsp;Reed, the sole remaining executive officers and employees of Celladon, providing for a cash bonus payment (an &#147;Executive Bonus Payment&#148;) to each of them in an amount equal to the cash severance and
retention benefit payments provided in each officer&#146;s previously existing employment and Retention Agreements (the &#147;Executive Bonus Agreements&#148;). The Executive Bonus Payment for each officer equaled the cash payment amount that each
such officer would have been entitled to under the terms of his or her employment agreement, as amended, and his or her Retention Agreement (collectively, the &#147;Prior Agreements&#148;) had such officer been terminated without cause or resigned
for good reason (or, with respect to the Retention Agreements, remained employed by Celladon on December&nbsp;31, 2015), and replaced and superseded each officer&#146;s right to any cash severance or retention benefits under the Prior Agreements.
Each officer&#146;s Executive Bonus Payment was subject to his or her delivery of an effective waiver and release of claims and was paid in late 2015 or early 2016. </P>

officers were eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan on the same basis as its other employees. The 401(k) plan was intended to qualify as a tax-qualified plan under Section&nbsp;401(k) of the Code. The plan provided that each participant could
contribute up to the lesser of 75% of his or her eligible compensation or the statutory limit, which was $18,000 for calendar year 2015. Participants that are 50 years or older could also make &#147;catch-up&#148; contributions, which in calendar
year 2015 may be up to an additional $6,000 above the statutory limit. Celladon provided an automatic matching contribution as follows: a match of 200% on the first 3% of compensation contributed by a participant and a match of 100% on amounts above
3%, up to 4% of compensation contributed by a participant. In general, eligible compensation for purposes of the 401(k) plan includes an employee&#146;s earnings reportable on IRS Form W-2 subject to certain adjustments, limits and exclusions
required under the Code. The 401(k) plan did not offer the ability to invest in Celladon&#146;s securities. Celladon terminated the 401(k) plan effective November 30, 2015. </P>

with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single set of Annual Meeting materials addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as &#147;householding,&#148; potentially means
extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This year, a number of brokers with account holders who are Eiger shareholders will be
&#147;householding&#148; the Company&#146;s proxy materials. A single set of Annual Meeting materials will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once
you have received notice from your broker that they will be &#147;householding&#148; communications to your address, &#147;householding&#148; will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no
longer wish to participate in &#147;householding&#148; and would prefer to receive a separate set of Annual Meeting materials, please notify your broker or Eiger. Direct your written request to Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., James Welch, Chief
Financial Officer, 350 Cambridge Ave., Suite 350, Palo Alto, CA 94306 or contact Mr. Welch at 650-272-6138. Shareholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Annual Meeting materials at their addresses and would like to request

Participant&#146;s Continuous Service (other than for Cause and other than upon the Participant&#146;s death or Disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration
requirements under the Securities Act, then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of a total period of time (that need not be consecutive) equal to the applicable post termination exercise period after the termination
of the Participant&#146;s Continuous Service during which the exercise of the Option or SAR would not be in violation of such registration requirements, and (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the applicable Award
Agreement. In addition, unless otherwise provided in a Participant&#146;s Award Agreement, if the sale of any Common Stock received on exercise of an Option or SAR following the termination of the Participant&#146;s Continuous Service (other than
for Cause) would violate the Company&#146;s insider trading policy, then the Option or SAR will terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of a period of months (that need not be consecutive) equal to the applicable post-termination exercise

derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or her regular rate of pay. To the extent permitted and/or required for compliance with the Worker Economic Opportunity Act to
ensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise, vesting or issuance of any shares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from the employee&#146;s regular rate of pay, the provisions of this Section 5(l)
