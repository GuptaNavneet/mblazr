<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage
biotechnology company with industry-leading expertise in the development of cardiovascular gene therapy. We apply our leadership position in the field of gene therapy and calcium dysregulation to develop novel therapies for diseases with high unmet
medical needs. Our lead programs target sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2+</SUP> -ATPase, or SERCA, enzymes, which are a family of enzymes that play an integral part in the regulation of intra-cellular
calcium in all human cells. Calcium dysregulation is implicated in a number of important and complex medical conditions and diseases, such as heart failure, which is a clinical syndrome characterized by poor heart function resulting in inadequate
blood flow to meet the body&#146;s metabolic needs, as well as blood vessel health, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. SERCA2a, an enzyme that becomes deficient in patients with heart failure, was scientifically validated as a molecular target
for heart failure in the 1990s and became a focus of internal discovery efforts for many large pharmaceutical companies. However, to date, no other company has been successful in targeting SERCA2a using traditional discovery methods. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our therapeutic portfolio includes both gene therapies and small molecule compounds targeting diseases characterized by SERCA enzyme
deficiency. MYDICAR, our most advanced product candidate, uses gene therapy to target SERCA2a. We believe that our gene therapy approach to modulating SERCA2a overcomes the issues encountered by previous efforts and has the potential to provide
transformative disease-modifying effects with long-term benefits in patients with heart failure. In addition, we have in-licensed worldwide rights to patents covering an additional gene therapy product opportunity, the membrane-bound form of Stem
Cell Factor, or mSCF, for the treatment of cardiac ischemic damage. We have also identified a number of potential first-in-class compounds addressing novel targets in diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases with our small molecule platform of
SERCA2b modulators. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are the first company to enter clinical development with a product candidate, MYDICAR, that selectively targets
SERCA2a. We refer to our Phase 1 trial and Phase 2a trial of MYDICAR together as our CUPID 1 trial. In Phase 2a of our CUPID 1 trial, 39 patients with heart failure for reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF, which is caused by the inability of the
heart to pump blood efficiently due to weakening and enlargement of the ventricles, were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. MYDICAR was safe and well-tolerated, reduced heart failure-related hospitalizations, improved
patients&#146; symptoms, quality of life and serum biomarkers and improved key markers of cardiac function predictive of survival, such as end systolic volume. Based on these results, as well as our previous preclinical studies and clinical trials,
we advanced MYDICAR to a 250-patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international Phase 2b trial in patients with HFrEF, which we refer to as CUPID 2. We completed enrollment of CUPID 2 in February 2014, reached the primary analysis
data cutoff in February 2015 and expect to un-blind the data and announce results in late April 2015. If successful, these results, along with other studies, could form the basis for regulatory submissions for approval with the United States Food
and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2012, we obtained a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA,
whereby the FDA agreed to use time-to-recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations as the primary endpoint for a MYDICAR Phase 3 pivotal trial. The design of our CUPID 2 trial is similar to the Phase 3 SPA protocol in that it includes the same
primary and secondary end points, and the same method of analysis. However, in CUPID&nbsp;2 we will use a modified intent to treat, or mITT, approach for the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. We have adopted an mITT approach for the
CUPID 2 trial in order to more accurately reflect intent to treat in the CUPID&nbsp;2 study, by excluding from the primary analysis clinical events that occurred in subjects prior to being dosed (with MYDICAR or placebo) or from those subjects who
were never dosed in the trial. Results from both the mITT and ITT approaches will need to be consistent to demonstrate a treatment effect. In April 2014, the FDA&#146;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, granted Breakthrough
Therapy designation to MYDICAR for reducing hospitalizations for heart failure in patients who test negative for adeno-associated viral vector 1, or AAV1, neutralizing antibodies, are class&nbsp;III or IV heart failure patients under the New York
Heart Association, </P>

development and review of innovative new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on a
clinically significant endpoint. MYDICAR was the first gene therapy product candidate to receive this designation, and the designation indicates that the FDA has determined that the CUPID&nbsp;1 trial provided preliminary clinical evidence that
MYDICAR may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies in heart failure patients for which the designation was granted. The FDA has confirmed that the primary efficacy endpoint of time-to-recurrent heart failure-related
hospitalizations in the presence of terminal events would be acceptable for a pivotal trial of MYDICAR. This endpoint counts multiple heart failure-related hospitalizations per patient, and adjusts for the occurrence of terminal events and the
correlation of multiple events in a single patient.&nbsp;We are using this endpoint in the ongoing CUPID 2 trial and plan to also use it in the next large clinical trial of MYDICAR, subject to regulatory feedback.&nbsp;More recently, the FDA has
confirmed its agreement regarding our use of the joint frailty statistical model as a method of analysis for the primary endpoint and that adequate control over type 1 error (false-positive rate) using the joint frailty model under different
conditions had been demonstrated based on FDA&#146;s review of our extensive simulation studies. In November 2013, the EMA indicated that if MYDICAR demonstrates a substantial and highly significant treatment effect in the advanced heart failure
population, a safety database of approximately 205 to 230 MYDICAR-treated subjects may be sufficient for a safety assessment for an MAA for MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF. Recently, the EMA has indicated that they are not satisfied that there is
adequate control of the type 1 error (false positive rate) with the joint frailty model. In addition, the EMA also indicated that for CUPID 2 to be considered as a single pivotal trial, a more extreme level of statistical significance than 5% would
be required. Based on regulatory guidance and our interactions with the FDA and EMA, it is possible that a Phase 3 trial may not be required for marketing approval, however, we are in the planning stages of an international trial (referred to as
CUPID-3 or CELL-003) similar to the CUPID 2 design, the size of which will be determined after CUPID 2 results are available.&nbsp;Depending on the outcome of CUPID 2 and the regulatory response to the results, the CUPID 3 trial could serve as an
additional trial for regulatory approval or to further characterize MYDICAR&#146;s therapeutic profile. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MYDICAR utilizes a recombinant
AAV1 serotype, which is a group of adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs, sharing specific antigens, to deliver the gene for the SERCA2a enzyme. We believe AAV1 serotype vectors are particularly well suited for administration to the heart muscle because
AAV vectors are safe and are less immunogenic than other viral vectors commonly used in gene therapy. Most people are exposed to wild type AAV (serotype 2) during childhood, without experiencing any symptoms, because AAV causes no disease. In
addition, local delivery of AAV1 to the heart requires extremely small quantities to achieve therapeutic effect, which has contributed to the low incidence of side effects in clinical trials to date. We have developed a companion diagnostic to
identify the patients who are AAV1 neutralizing antibody, or NAb, negative and therefore eligible for MYDICAR treatment. We believe approximately 40% of patients in the United States are AAV1 NAb negative. In an effort to expand the population of
patients who may be eligible for MYDICAR treatment for HFrEF, we are exploring whether plasma exchange can be used to remove AAV1 NAbs from the circulation in advance of MYDICAR administration, and have plans for a possible Phase 1/2 study of
MYDICAR in advanced heart failure patients with HFrEF and pre-existing levels of NAb against the AAV1 vector, who would undergo plasma exchange prior to administration of MYDICAR. Plans for this study are pending the outcome of the CUPID 2 trial to
further evaluate the benefit-to-risk ratio and further discussions with the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2015, the American Heart Association estimated that
there are nearly six million patients currently diagnosed with heart failure in the United States. Despite optimal guideline-directed therapies employing a wide range of pharmacologic, device, and surgical options, many heart failure patients
deteriorate over time. The long-term prognosis associated with heart failure is worse than that associated with the majority of cancers, with a mortality rate of approximately 50% at five years following initial diagnosis. There are one million

estimated direct cost of heart failure in the United States in 2012 was $60.2 billion, half of which was related to repeated hospitalizations. The one- and six-month readmission rates after heart

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are initially developing MYDICAR to treat HFrEF patients. HFrEF is characterized by a decreased contraction of the heart muscle. We are
also investigating MYDICAR for additional indications, including arteriovenous fistula, or AVF, maturation failure, and for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure who are on an LVAD. In addition, if supported by the CUPID 2 results,
we expect to initiate a clinical trial in 2016 for the treatment of diastolic heart failure (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF), a condition caused by the inability of the heart to relax normally between contractions. MYDICAR
has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of this condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We hold worldwide rights to MYDICAR in all indications and markets. We

failure patients. We believe we can maximize the value of our company by retaining certain commercialization rights to our product candidates and, where appropriate, entering into partnerships for specific therapeutic indications and/or geographic
territories. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also investigating MYDICAR for enhancing the rate of AVF maturation and are completing preclinical work which is
necessary to support our investigational new drug, or IND, application for this new indication. Pending completion of this preclinical work and agreement by the FDA, we intend to conduct a Phase 2a trial with MYDICAR in end-stage renal disease
patients undergoing surgery for AVF creation. Over 500,000 Americans have end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis and approximately 100,000 fistulae are placed yearly. An AVF, which is a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein,
is placed in the arm to provide access for hemodialysis. The access that is created is routinely used for hemodialysis two to five times per week. The AVF has proven to be the most durable, least complicated, and therefore preferred mode of vascular
access for hemodialysis. The clinical problem that has resulted from this practice is that following surgery to create the fistula, approximately 50% of fistulae fail to mature to a usable state for hemodialysis. Furthermore, as many as 25% of
hospital admissions in the dialysis population have been attributed to vascular access problems, including fistula malfunction and thrombosis. The biology of SERCA2a in both vascular smooth muscle cells, or VSMC, and endothelial cells provides a
unique opportunity to potentially positively impact the pathological processes driving fistula failure. The majority of AVF maturation failures have been attributed to rapid proliferation of VSMC, resulting in vascular blockage or occlusion. In
preclinical studies, SERCA2a enzyme deficiency has been associated with VSMC proliferation, and increasing SERCA2a activity has been shown to prevent VSMC proliferation and stenosis of injured blood vessels. In addition to stenosis, maturation of
AVF requires that the blood vessels dilate to support the increased blood flow during dialysis sessions. MYDICAR increases blood flow in treated vessels, and therefore these effects may aid AVF maturation. </P>

intricate workings of the heart, calcium is considered perhaps the most important. Proper calcium cycling enables the chambers of the heart to pump, or contract and relax, which causes blood to be propelled in and out of the heart. Calcium directly
activates the myofilaments, which are threadlike structures in muscle fibers which cause contraction. Dysregulation of calcium is a central cause of heart failure due to both contractile (systolic) dysfunction, and relaxation (diastolic)
dysfunction. One of the central causes of calcium dysregulation in heart failure is a deficiency in the level of SERCA2a enzymes in heart muscle cells. SERCA2a deficiencies are not limited to heart muscle cells, but are also present in blood vessel
disorders such as AVF maturation failure and PAH. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another focus of our research program relates to a different form of the SERCA2 enzyme,
SERCA2b. Specifically, these enzymes control calcium movement in the ER in all human cells. SERCA2b enzyme levels become deficient when cells are stressed, and accumulate unfolded proteins in the ER, known as ER stress. There has been a
proliferation of publications in scientific medical literature supporting the important role of ER stress in many diseases and conditions, including heart failure, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. We believe we are the industry leader in
isolating small molecule modulators of the SERCA2b enzyme, which can correct underlying calcium dysregulation and ER stress. Our proprietary, novel, first-in-class, compounds have demonstrated activity in multiple preclinical models of diseases and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Heart failure constitutes an important medical, social, and economic problem. Heart failure is a clinical condition in which the output of
blood from the heart is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body. In 2015, the American Heart Association estimated that there are nearly six million patients currently diagnosed with heart failure in the United States. The prevalence
of heart failure is progressively increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity and diabetes. Additional risk factors for heart failure include coronary heart disease,
hypertension, alcoholism, drug abuse, exposure to toxins and infectious agents, pregnancy and congenital mutations. It is estimated that one in five adults at age 40 will develop heart failure during their remaining lifetime, and that approximately
250,000 to 500,000 patients in the United States are currently in the terminal phase of heart failure and have symptoms that cannot be effectively managed by existing optimized medical therapy. These patients suffer from disabling symptoms and often
need hospitalization. The long-term prognosis associated with heart failure is worse than that associated with the majority of cancers, with approximate 50% mortality at five years following initial diagnosis. With over 280,000 heart failure-related
deaths annually, we believe MYDICAR will provide a much needed therapeutic alternative for heart failure patients. We estimate that there are over 350,000 HFrEF patients in the United States who would be eligible for MYDICAR treatment upon launch,
if approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hospitalizations for heart failure are expensive and are particularly problematic, as the risk of death is increased with
each recurrent heart failure-related hospitalization. There are one million primary heart failure-related hospitalizations annually in the United States alone. The estimated direct cost of heart failure in the United States in 2012 was $60.2
billion, half of which was related to repeated hospitalizations. By 2030, the total </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
cost of heart failure in the United States is projected to increase to $70 billion. The one- and six-month readmission rates after heart failure-related hospitalization are close to 25% and 50%,
respectively. The Affordable Care Act recently established the &#147;Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program,&#148; which requires Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services to reduce payments to hospitals with excessive heart failure
readmissions. As such, there is a growing pressure on hospitals to reduce readmissions for heart failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The pathologies resulting from
heart failure are devastating. During heart failure progression, the heart steadily loses its ability to respond to increased metabolic demand, such as during intense physical activity. Patients suffer from increased shortness of breath in a
progressive manner, and mild exercise soon exceeds the capacity of the heart to react to the increase in metabolic demand. Towards the end stage of the disease, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet what the body needs even at rest. At this
stage, fluids accumulate in the extremities or in the lungs, making the patient bedridden and unable to perform activities of daily living. In addition to constant shortness of breath, even minor deviation from a physical activity and diet
restricted lifestyle can cause acute exacerbations, during which patients experience a drowning sensation and must be urgently hospitalized in intensive care or cardiac care units. Heart failure is classified in relation to the severity of the
symptoms experienced by the patient. The most commonly used classification system, established by the New York Heart Association, or NYHA, is as follows: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

classes of heart failure is a function of the severity of the disease with the more advanced patients having poorer survival prognosis. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure emphasizes angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE,
inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers if the patient is ACE intolerant, and beta blockers. There is recommendation for cardiac resynchronization therapy in certain patients. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, or ICDs, are used in
patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. Despite these optimal guideline-directed therapies employing a wide range of pharmacologic, device, and surgical options, many patients deteriorate over time and develop advanced heart failure symptoms that
cannot be effectively managed by existing optimized medical therapy. At the end stage of heart failure disease, current treatment options include heart transplant surgery or implantation of an LVAD. LVADs are battery operated mechanical circulatory
devices used to partially or completely replace the function of the left ventricle of the heart for patients awaiting a heart transplant, or as a destination therapy for patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure who will never receive a heart
transplant. Both of these end-stage treatment options require invasive open-chest surgery, include a host of complications such as lifetime immunosuppressive therapy in the case of transplant and risk of thrombosis and infection in the case of
LVADs, and can cost in excess of $150,000. An estimated 1,500 patients per year in the United States have an LVAD implanted and an estimated 2,300 patients per year in the United States undergo heart transplant surgery. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Heart failure is characterized by abnormalities in the various steps of the heart muscle pumping
process. Intracellular calcium movements in the heart are tightly regulated at various levels within the heart&#146;s cells. An organelle called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or SR, plays an important role in orchestrating the movement of calcium
during each contraction and relaxation. The cardiac cycle is illustrated in the figure below. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="font-size:0pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

contraction. During relaxation, the majority of calcium is sequestered back into the SR by the SERCA2a enzyme leading to muscle relaxation. It is modulated through normal physiology via a protein known as phospholamban (PLB in the figure above),
increasing activity when we exercise and decreasing activity when we rest. In advanced heart failure, SERCA2a enzyme levels are abnormally low, so patients cannot effectively modulate SERCA2a activity which disrupts the normal calcium cycle. In
turn, this negatively impacts normal contraction and relaxation and prevents the increase of cardiac output, even upon mild physical activity, such as walking or climbing stairs. </P>

serious medical condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Heart failure can be caused by a problem with cardiac contraction (systole), relaxation (diastole), or both.
Ejection fraction, or EF, is the measurement used to describe the contractility of the heart. Approximately half of heart failure patients suffer from contractility abnormalities (EF less than 35%, HFrEF) while the other half suffer from relaxation
(or diastolic) abnormalities (HFpEF). Both forms represent a significant unmet medical need. We are currently developing MYDICAR for HRrEF, but pending analysis of the CUPID 2 data, we also plan to develop MYDICAR to target the diastolic form of the
disease (HFpEF). HFpEF is characterized by a stiff ventricle, which impairs relaxation of the heart between contractions. We believe MYDICAR can effectively treat HFpEF by correcting the SERCA2a deficiency and improving the ability of the heart to
relax between contractions. Based on the Framingham Heart Study conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University, the five-year mortality rate for patients with HFpEF is 45&#150;60%, which demonstrates the significant
unmet need for effective treatments for this condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>MYDICAR: Genetic Enzyme Replacement Therapy of SERCA2a Deficiency

failure patients that results in inadequate pumping of the heart. MYDICAR is delivered one-time, directly to the heart over a 10 minute period, in a routine outpatient procedure similar to an angiogram in a cardiac catheterization laboratory.
MYDICAR has the potential to provide transformative disease-modifying effects with long-term benefits in heart failure patients with a single administration. We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, in December 2006 for MYDICAR for
the treatment of heart failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gene therapy alters a person&#146;s deficient genetic material (encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid, or
DNA). The altered genes, in turn, through a process called gene expression, can then produce the correct proteins and/or enzymes that were otherwise being produced improperly, or in the case of SERCA2 deficiency, at abnormally low levels. Gene
therapy is accomplished through a process known as gene transfer, whereby a functional gene is delivered and incorporated into a patient&#146;s cells through a delivery system called a vector, which are most commonly based on naturally-occurring

are modified to be non-replicating by deleting that portion of the viral genome responsible for replication. We believe that the growing body of gene therapy-based clinical data and the establishment of regulatory guidelines to govern the
development and approval of gene therapy products suggest that gene therapy is positioned to emerge as an important new therapeutic modality for patients with significant unmet medical need. </P>

delay to the onset of clinical events, and in the high-dose group a significant reduction. In the low- and mid-dose groups, we believe the dose was not sufficient to insert the SERCA2a gene in enough cells of the myocardium to generate a
long-lasting improvement in contractility. We have confirmed this in biopsy samples (see &#147;CUPID 1 (CELL-001) Long-term Follow-up&#148; below), since MYDICAR vector DNA was only detected at long time points in cardiac biopsies in the high-dose
patients, but not in biopsies from any other group. MYDICAR increases the presence of an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells and this enables blood vessels to relax, thereby resulting in short-term increased blood flow. Our
hypothesis for why the low- and mid-dose groups demonstrate a delay of the onset of clinical events which is not durable relates to the short-term increase in blood flow to the heart after MYDICAR therapy; higher doses are required to insert the
gene deep into the cardiac muscle cells. </P>

protocol under the SPA guidance and agreed that the design and planned analyses of this trial would be sufficient to provide data that, depending on the outcome, could support a license application submission. Pursuant to the SPA, we also obtained
an agreement from the FDA that the primary efficacy endpoint of time to recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations would be acceptable for a pivotal trial of MYDICAR, using an ITT population for the primary analysis. This endpoint includes
multiple heart failure-related hospitalizations per patient, and &#147;corrects&#148; for within-subject correlation and informative censoring from terminal events. Other elements of the Phase 3 SPA protocol, including sample size, may be changed if
agreed to in writing by both the FDA and us. In April 2014, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to MYDICAR for reducing hospitalizations for heart failure in patients who test negative for AAV1 NAbs, are class III or IV heart failure
patients under the New York Heart Association, or NYHA, classification system, and are not in immediate need of a left-ventricular assist device, or LVAD, or heart transplant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The design of our CUPID 2 trial is similar to the Phase 3 SPA protocol in that it includes the same primary and secondary end points, and the
same method of analysis. However, in CUPID&nbsp;2 we will use an mITT approach for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. We have adopted an mITT approach for the CUPID&nbsp;2 trial in order to more accurately reflect intent to treat in
the CUPID&nbsp;2 study. We also discussed with the FDA our proposed use of an mITT population for the primary and secondary endpoint analyses, which excludes clinical events which occurred in patients that did not receive MYDICAR or placebo, or
which occurred prior to dosing. This represents less than 5% of the clinical events that would have been included in an intent to treat analysis. Results from both the mITT and ITT approaches will need to be consistent to demonstrate a treatment
effect. We believe that this is the appropriate approach for the CUPID 2 trial based on Section&nbsp;5.2.1 of ICH Guidance for Industry, E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (Section V.B.1. of the corresponding FDA Guidance for Industry E9
Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials, September 1998) which provides that in some situations, it may be reasonable to eliminate from the set of all randomized subjects any subject who took no trial medication. In these situations, the
intention-to-treat principle would be preserved despite the exclusion of these patients provided that the decision of whether or not to begin treatment could not be influenced by knowledge of the assigned treatment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2012, we participated in European Scientific Advice Meetings with local authorities at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany and the College ter
Beoordeling van Geneesmiddelen, Medicines Evaluation Board in the Netherlands. Advice from these meetings was incorporated into the Clinical Trial Application for the CUPID 2 clinical trial. In November 2013 we met with the Scientific Advice Working
Part of the EMA to obtain scientific advice regarding the overall development program and most expeditious approval route for MYDICAR and advice from this meeting was incorporated into the development program. In November 2013, the EMA indicated
that if MYDICAR demonstrates a substantial and highly significant treatment effect in the advanced heart failure population, a safety database of approximately 205-230 MYDICAR-treated subjects may be sufficient for a safety assessment of an MAA for
MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF. Recently the EMA has indicated that they are not satisfied that adequate control of type 1 error (false positive rate) by the joint frailty model to be used for the primary efficacy analysis had been demonstrated.
In addition, the EMA indicated that for this study to be considered as a single pivotal trial, a more extreme level of statistical significance than 5% would be required. We believe that our extensive simulation studies have demonstrated that when

and tissues via the mononuclear phagocyte system in liver, spleen and lymph nodes, and lungs. After intracoronary delivery, AAV particles which are not taken up in cardiac tissues are first passed through to the lung via the coronary sinus, making
this the first pass organ. Stable, long-term presence of viral DNA, SERCA2a protein, and vector-derived SERCA2a mRNA have been demonstrated in cardiac tissue of normal rats for up to one year following a single administration of MYDICAR. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gene transfer of SERCA2a is associated with improved cardiac function in various rodent models of heart failure. Improved heart function and
enhanced expression of SERCA2 have also been demonstrated in an ovine (sheep) pacing-induced heart failure model with MYDICAR. SERCA2 gene transfer has also been associated with restoration of SERCA2a expression and improved heart function in both a
dog-pacing heart failure model and in a chronic myocardial ischemia-induced heart failure model in mini-pigs. Beyond the effects on enhancing contractility, SERCA2a gene transfer has been shown in preclinical studies to restore the energetic state
of the heart (both in terms of energy supply and utilization), to decrease arrhythmias, and enhance blood flow to the heart through expression in endothelial cells. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Several studies we have sponsored have established pharmacologic activity for MYDICAR gene transfer in animals with heart failure, with data
demonstrating restored SERCA2a expression and stabilization/improvement in heart function. The pharmacology study was conducted in the porcine (pig) mitral regurgitation, or MR, heart failure model. MR induces reduced myocardial contractility,
elevated B-type natriuretic peptide, or BNP, levels and other signs and markers which are virtually identical to those associated with the human disease, including a decrease in SERCA2a expression. MYDICAR-treated animals demonstrated significant
improvements in the heart&#146;s ability to contract and relax and improved ventricular volumes. In these studies, there was an absolute increase of 16% in median EF in MYDICAR-treated animals as compared to control animals. ESV increased in the
control group by a median of 16 milliliters, or a median relative increase of 35%, an indication of decreased contractility and cardiac enlargement, compared with the MYDICAR group, which showed a tendency to decrease LV ESV by a median of 9.9
milliliters (a median decrease of 14%). In humans, a reduction in ESV of 10% signifies clinically relevant reverse remodeling, which is a strong predictor of lower long-term mortality and heart failure clinical events. Treated animals also had lower
BNP levels post-dosing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have also sponsored two safety toxicology and biodistribution studies, both in normal mini-pigs. Both were
three-month studies simulating the clinical administration procedure for MYDICAR or placebo with 5, 30 and 90 day sacrifice time points. Doses of up to three times the human dose on a weight-adjusted basis were administered. No mortalities were
observed in either study and treatment with MYDICAR was not associated with any signs of toxicity or effects on body weight, sperm motility, clinical pathology, gross pathology, clinical chemistry parameters, organ weights or histopathology. No
significant effects were observed on cardiovascular parameters, including electrocardiographic intervals. There were no test article-related observations during the necropsies. Mild increases in troponin I were observed in eight out of a total of 36
MYDICAR-treated animals in the first study, barely above upper limits of normal for humans. These increases were not considered to be related to MYDICAR or biologically significant and were not observed in the second study. No treatment related
changes in troponin I values were observed across the other large animal pharmacology studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>MYDICAR in Additional Indications </B></P>

arteriovenous fistula, or AVF, which is a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein in the arm of the patient, has proven to be the most durable, least complicated, and therefore preferred mode of vascular access for hemodialysis.
The access that is created is routinely used for hemodialysis two to five times per week. Approximately 100,000 fistulae are placed yearly in the United States. However, a clinical problem that has resulted from this practice is that, following
surgery to create the fistula, approximately 50% of the fistulae fail to mature to a usable state, and as many as 25% of hospital admissions in the dialysis population have been attributed to vascular access problems, including fistula malfunction
and thrombosis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Role of SERCA2a in Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation Failure </I></B></P>

hemodialysis. The role of SERCA2a in normal and diseased blood vessel biology has been extensively studied. Maturation failure of an AVF has been attributed to rapid proliferation of VSMC, resulting in vascular occlusion. The histological lesion
that appears to be associated with early AVF failure is referred to as neointimal hyperplasia, comprising VSMC, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells within microvessels. In the setting of early AVF failure, both aggressive neointimal hyperplasia and
adverse vascular remodeling (vasoconstriction or an inability to dilate adequately) plays a role. In particular, the combination of early and aggressive neointimal hyperplasia together with adverse vascular remodeling results in aggressive early
stenosis. The biology of SERCA2a in both VSMC and endothelial cells provides a unique opportunity to potentially positively impact these pathological processes: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Foundation and is sponsored by Imperial College London. We are providing investigational medicinal product and some financial support. It is not a required trial by any regulatory authorities; however, it could potentially serve as a
proof-of-concept trial to support the use of MYDICAR to wean patients off of an LVAD. The use of these devices present a host of risk factors for the patient, such as increased risk of thrombosis and infections, and these devices do not last for
long periods of time. Given that the circulatory system of a patient with an LVAD is dependent on these devices, device failure usually translates to a catastrophic event for the patient. The primary objectives of the SERCA2a-LVAD trial are to
determine (1)&nbsp;the safety and feasibility of using MYDICAR to treat heart failure patients who have an LVAD, (2)&nbsp;how well MYDICAR delivers the gene for SERCA2a to heart cells and (3)&nbsp;what impact circulating NAbs to AAV1 have on the
ability of MYDICAR to deliver the SERCA2a gene to heart muscle cells. This trial is expected to enroll approximately 24 patients in the United Kingdom with varying levels of circulating NAbs to AAV1, 16 of whom will be treated with MYDICAR and eight
with placebo. Six months post-treatment, all patients will undergo a heart biopsy for collection of tissue to determine the presence of the SERCA2a gene. In addition, safety data and changes in LV function will be collected and analyzed. As of
March&nbsp;11, 2015, there were five subjects enrolled in this study. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>MYDICAR for HFpEF </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As in HFrEF, a consistent finding in HFpEF is a decrease in the expression of SERCA2a&#151;a change that is seen in most animal models of heart
failure and in human hearts with diastolic dysfunction. In preclinical studies, overexpressing SERCA2a using gene therapy in streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice demonstrated that increasing SERCA2a could improve diastolic function. In human
cardiomyocytes isolated from the left ventricle of patients with end-stage heart failure, SERCA2a levels were correlated with improved diastolic function. We have also evaluated MYDICAR in another preclinical study in a rat model for spontaneous
non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by diastolic dysfunction and associated with abnormal calcium levels and decrease in SERCA2a expression. In this study, SERCA2a gene transfer restored diastolic function to
normal. These data showed that SERCA2a overexpression may be used as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SERCA2a
gene transfer has also been demonstrated to improve diastolic cardiac function in aged animals. In preclinical studies, cardiac SERCA2a protein and ATPase activity were significantly decreased in elderly rat hearts compared with adult rats and were
restored to adult levels after SERCA2a gene transfer. Diastolic function parameters, which were adversely affected in elderly rat hearts, were restored by overexpression of SERCA2a, supporting the hypothesis that decreased SERCA2a contributes to the
functional abnormalities observed in elderly hearts and demonstrating that targeting SERCA2a in the elderly heart may lead to improved diastolic cardiac function. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The MYDICAR-HFpEF trial would be our pilot clinical trial for the treatment of HFpEF, which comprises approximately half of all heart failure
cases. We anticipate that the existing data we have generated for our proposed HFrEF indication would allow us to launch directly into a Phase 1/2 trial. Pending the outcome of CUPID 2, we expect to initiate clinical studies for this proposed
indication in 2016. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a syndrome defined by complex vascular disease and an increase in pulmonary artery pressure that
results in heart failure and premature death in affected patients. The lungs in PAH patients are characterized by changes in the structure of small pulmonary arteries reducing artery diameter and impeding flow through them. This induces a rise in
pulmonary vascular resistance, increasing the stress on the right side of the heart which progresses to an enlarged and impaired right ventricle, a decrease in cardiac output, heart failure, and death. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In both animal models and samples from human patients with PAH, pulmonary tissue shows reduced expression of SERCA2a, an enzyme critical for
proper pumping of calcium in calcium compartments within the vascular smooth muscle cells. When these vascular smooth muscle cells begin to proliferate under pathological conditions, SERCA2a expression is lost. In addition, overexpression of SERCA2a
in endothelial cells results in increased nitric oxide release and vasodilation of the arteries. In PAH animal studies, an exogenous SERCA2a gene via gene therapy using MYDICAR has introduced a healthy SERCA2a gene into pulmonary cells using a
nebulizer-like inhalation device. MYDICAR has demonstrated evidence of PAH reversal in rat and pig models of the disease. In a pig model of PAH, a single one-time dose inhaled tracheal delivery of MYDICAR, at two months, resulted in significant
decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance, improvement in RV function, reduction in the fulton index (size of right ventricle/size of left ventricle + Septum) and reverse remodeling of the pulmonary
arteries. We are currently conducting a follow-up study in a pig model, evaluating the durability of a single dose of MYDICAR at six months. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Small

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following our acquisition in July 2014 of worldwide rights to gene therapy applications for the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">membrane-bound</FONT> form of Stem Cell Factor for treatment of cardiac ischemia, we are pursuing an additional gene therapy product opportunity in mSCF for the treatment of cardiac ischemic damage. Stem cell
research to date has demonstrated potential to treat heart failure, pulmonary disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson&#146;s disease, Huntington&#146;s disease, Celiac Disease, muscle damage, along with many others. mSCF is a powerful growth
signal for c-<I>kit</I><SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">+</SUP> stem cells, and is the ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor c-<I>kit</I>. mSCF induces c-kit<B>+ </B>stem/progenitor cell expansion <I>in situ</I>, as well as
cardiomyocyte proliferation, which may represent a new therapeutic strategy to reverse adverse remodeling after cardiac injury. In a preclinical setting, mSCF has demonstrated potential improvements in cardiac function and survival following a
myocardial infarction. Specifically, these data suggest mSCF gene therapy promoted a regenerative response characterized by an enhancement in cardiac hemodynamic function; an improvement in survival; a reduction in fibrosis, infarct size and
apoptosis; an increase in cardiac c-kit<B>+ </B>progenitor cells recruitment to the injured area; an increase in cardiomyocyte cell-cycle activation; and Wnt/&szlig;-catenin pathway induction. To date, however, cell therapy for tissue repair has
been hampered by the complexities of using cells as products from a delivery, manufacturing, and regulatory perspective. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our approach
with mSCF gene therapy is to recruit and expand <I>resident </I>stem cells, thereby harnessing advances in gene therapy technologies and also expanding the application to those in which cardiac stem cells have shown promise in clinical and
preclinical testing. We are currently generating gene therapy vectors in support of potentially conducting a future clinical trial in patients who have suffered cardiac damage, as well as exploration of other potential applications. Preclinical
studies using AAV mediated vector delivery of the mSCF gene for promoting cardiac regeneration post myocardial infarction are planned for 2015. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently have full worldwide commercial rights to all of our development programs. We believe we can maximize the value of our company by
retaining substantial commercialization rights to our product candidates and, where appropriate, entering into partnerships for specific therapeutic indications and/or geographic territories. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current strategy is to market MYDICAR for all potential heart failure indications using a dedicated specialty sales force calling on
selected cardiologists, heart failure specialists and other health care providers. These physicians are typically affiliated with leading hospitals and medical centers and we believe that they tend to have well-established referral networks with
supporting interventional cardiologists and cardiac catheterization laboratories. We believe they represent a concentrated customer base suitable to a specialty sales model. We believe that MYDICAR would be adopted first by high-volume
key-opinion-leader hospitals and medical centers, and progressively by a broader segment of the market. Cardiologists, heart failure specialists, and interventional cardiologists, have a history of early adoption of innovative products and
technologies, in part because the rate of innovation in this sector has been sustained, and in part because of the large unmet need that their patients exhibit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We therefore believe that a commercial strategy involving a progressive build out of commercial infrastructure in the United States covering
key prescribers and centers of excellence is one that we can realistically pursue. Our commercialization strategy for MYDICAR in different geographies and indications beyond heart failure will continue to be evaluated and may involve strategic
partners. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Manufacturing of MYDICAR (AAV1/SERCA2a) </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AAV has many characteristics that facilitate large scale manufacturing and distribution, when exploited effectively. We believe that our
significant investment in AAV1/SERCA2a process development and analytical characterization has paid off in an inherently scalable, proprietary manufacturing process that is capable of supplying a global market as large as heart failure with a gene
therapy product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The technology includes a coordinated design of the AAV1/SERCA2a vector genome (the vector DNA) and the production
system. AAV vectors are made &#147;gutless,&#148; meaning that they do not contain viral genes. Only the two small non-coding elements from the parent virus are needed for replicating and packaging the vector DNA during production, which can be
provided separately. The genome was also designed to be very close to the size of the parent AAV genome, to optimally fit within the AAV capsid. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our state of the art manufacturing process for AAV1/SERCA2a was developed based on proven industrial cell culture methodologies. Like many of
the manufacturers of recombinant monoclonal antibodies or proteins, we use cell-suspension based culturing techniques and intend to use stirred tank bioreactors for large scale cell culture and production. Our planned commercial production scale is
2,000 liters, which is one-tenth the volume of the largest industrial production vessels, so our anticipated production scale is well within the limits of the technology. We selected stirred tank production bioreactor technology as our production
system because it has been the workhorse for recombinant protein production for more than 20 years. For purification of AAV1/SERCA2a, we use industrial chromatography columns and resins, and filtration technology common to the biopharmaceutical
industry. We believe these materials and equipment are common for manufacturing of FDA approved biological products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Approach for

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We use standard cell culture techniques and standard equipment in production and purification
found in industrial scale cell culture drug manufacturing. All media used for cell growth and production are free of animal serum and of high risk animal-derived components. To induce production of AAV1/SERCA2a, the cells are infected with a highly
characterized batch of adenovirus. AAV viruses in nature and AAV vectors are not capable of replicating on their own and require a helper virus, such as adenovirus, to initiate replication. The purification process was designed to yield a high
purity AAV1/SERCA2a product. Special attention was placed on the inactivation and removal of adenovirus and its free components, clearance of DNA and protein impurities, and even intact host cells. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MYDICAR drug product is produced by an FDA registered contract manufacturer. The manufacturing process is relatively simple: drug product is
diluted to a specified concentration, filter-sterilized, and vials are aseptically filled into single-use standard pharmaceutical grade vials and stoppered using an automated filling machine. The final drug product is stored frozen or refrigerated
until use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Plans for Scale-Up and Our Approach to Commercial Manufacturing </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our production process was successfully scaled up from lab scale to the 250-liter clinical scale. Of the limited number of batches produced at
250 liters, two batches were successfully produced at Targeted Genetics Corporation (now AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation) in Seattle, Washington. We have transferred the manufacturing process to a contract manufacturer, Lonza Houston Inc., or LHI,
in Houston, Texas. In December 2014, these activities culminated in the cGMP manufacture of a 2,000 liter batch with the primary objective of demonstrating scale-up and informing commercial facility design. Sample testing from the demonstration
batch is currently in process. Two additional 2,000 liter batches are planned for production at LHI in 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are working with Lonza as
our contract manufacturing organization for the production of AAV1/SERCA2a for our clinical studies. In addition, we have recently entered into an agreement with Novasep and are currently conducting the initial analytical and process transfer
activities necessary for Novasep to achieve production of AAV1/SERCA2a. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The AAV1/SERCA2a manufacturing process is designed and operated
using standard off-the-shelf equipment, including a 2,000-liter disposable bioreactor platform. The concept is to have a production train that can be replicated in standardized fashion to ensure that from facility to facility the manufacturing
process is operated exactly the same using identical equipment, material and supplies. We anticipate that one production train will meet our global product requirements for our expected first indication, HFrEF. However, if actual product demand is
greater than anticipated or additional indications gain approval, we believe that the standardized approach will allow for an easy and quick start-up of additional production trains. Our approach is designed to minimize capital costs and provide
nimbleness and expandability of the production process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>MYDICAR Clinical and Commercial Supply </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently have enough MYDICAR clinical supplies (drug product) to complete the MYDICAR-LVAD and AGENT-HF trials. We also have sufficient
remaining drug product to provide clinical supplies for all of our currently planned Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, including the high dose trial, the AAV NAb positive trial, the viral shedding trial, and the MYDICAR-AVF maturation trial, if
commenced. At least one additional batch of drug substance and drug product will be required to conduct the CELL-003 trial and an HFpEF trial, if commenced. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current plan for commercial manufacturing is to potentially maintain dual source commercial supply relationships with Lonza, Novasep

into their target cells. Preclinical and limited clinical results with AAV1 NAb positive animals or patients, as well as <I>in vitro</I> neutralization experiments, have demonstrated that the detection of AAV1 NAbs is important prior to treatment
with MYDICAR. Our experience in our CUPID 1 and CUPID 2 trials indicates that approximately 40% of the heart failure patients in the United States are AAV1 NAb negative and hence eligible for MYDICAR therapy. In other countries, such as Poland, the
prevalence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs is significantly higher. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have developed a companion diagnostic AAV1 NAb assay for use in
combination with MYDICAR in order to qualify subjects for treatment in clinical trials and for commercial use. The AAV1 NAb assay is intended to measure the loss of infectivity of AAV1/GFP (green fluorescent protein), an AAV1 recombinant particle
with a reporter gene, following treatment with subject&#146;s serum (i.e., neutralization). Diluted samples of a subject&#146;s serum are incubated with AAV1/GFP, and then the mixture is tested for vector activity/infectivity <I>in vitro</I> on a
permissive cell line (testing the relative gene expression (fluorescence) as a measure of vector neutralization). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, our tests to
measure a potential clinical trial participant&#146;s level of pre-existing NAbs have been performed for us by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. We expect that the commercial assay, if approved, would be automated and similarly run by a
strategic partner in at least two locations worldwide. It is not expected that the assay will be provided to the laboratories as a stand-alone kit but that approved laboratories would purchase the cells, controls and critical reagent, AAV1/GFP, from
qualified suppliers. We intend that Quality System regulation set forth in 21 CFR Part 820 would be followed for the manufacture of AAV1/GFP and for the performance of the assay. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require
separate regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercial use. We anticipate that our companion diagnostic will require approval under a pre-market approval application, or PMA, submitted to the FDA&#146;s Center for Devices and Radiological
Health, or CDRH, prior to commercialization. We further anticipate that regulatory approval of our companion diagnostic will be a prerequisite to our ability to market MYDICAR. Representatives of CDRH have participated in our meetings with the
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regarding MYDICAR to discuss the potential use of our companion diagnostic, and we anticipate that future meetings will include representatives from both CBER and CDRH to ensure that the BLA
submission (for MYDICAR) and PMA submission (for the companion diagnostic) are coordinated and subject to parallel review by these respective FDA centers. Accordingly, our objective is to align the development programs such that the companion
diagnostic will be developed and approved contemporaneously with MYDICAR. In 2014, CE Marking was obtained for the companion diagnostic in Europe. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries in which we operate are subject to rapid change and are characterized by intense competition to
develop new technologies and proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical companies. While we believe that MYDICAR&#146;s unique mechanism of action provides us
with competitive advantages, particularly given that MYDICAR is designed to be administered in conjunction with other pharmacological agents and devices (except LVADs), we have identified several companies which are active in the advancement of gene
therapy products in the heart failure arena as of the date of this report. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy treatments, any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies
and new therapies that may become available in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are developing
gene therapy products for the treatment of heart failure include Renova Therapeutics, NanoCor Therapeutics, Juventas Therapeutics, VentriNova and Beat BioTherapeutics. Renova, Beat BioTherapeutics and Juventas are in the clinical stages of
development with their gene therapy products targeting moderate to advanced heart failure. Renova is using adenovirus serotype 5 encoding human adenylyl cyclase type 6 in a Phase 1/2 trial, while Juventas is enrolling a Phase 2 trial with its
product candidate JVS100, which is a non-viral plasmid that encodes for stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). UniQure (AAV delivery of S100A1), NanoCor (BNP delivery of I1), VentriNova (cyclin A2), and Beat BioTherapeutics (AAV/R1R2) are in the
preclinical testing of product candidates. These companies also compete with us in recruiting human capital and securing licenses to complementary technologies that may be critical to the success of our business. They also compete with us for
potential funding from the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Our potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. In addition, as the presence of pre-existing NAbs against the
proteins that encapsulate the AAV1 gene therapy agent can block entry of the AAV1 gene therapy agents into their target cells, previous patient exposure to other AAV1-based gene therapies, irrespective of the condition or disease they aim to treat,
would render a patient ineligible for MYDICAR therapy and could therefore be considered competitive to MYDICAR. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the key
competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of MYDICAR and any other product candidates that we develop are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, value, price and the
availability of reimbursement from the government and other third-parties. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors have products which are better in one or more of these categories. </P>

countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or parent application, if applicable). For example, if an international Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT,
application is filed, any patent issuing from the PCT application in a specific country expires 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application. In the United States, however, if a patent was in force on June&nbsp;8, 1995, or issued on an

permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted
commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the
submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE for only one patent applicable to an approved drug, and the maximum period of restoration is five years beyond the expiration of the patent. A PTE
cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and a patent can only be extended once, and thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on
one product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in
the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for PTEs for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For additional

cardiovascular disease by infusion of a therapeutic nucleic acid into the coronary circulation over a specified period of time. It does not include our issued patent in this family, which includes claims to the concurrent use of a vasodilating

applications included within the patent rights subject to the option, we will enter into a separate license agreement with AskBio with respect to such license with previously agreed upon payment terms. Although the scope of the license granted to
AskBio upon exercise of the option would enable AskBio to develop and commercialize a competing product with respect to the patent rights to which the option applies, we believe that the exclusion of our issued patent from that license, and the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&amp;C
Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&amp;C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing,
manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing
of a biological product begins, and each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA
approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure
of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. To date, the FDA has never approved a gene therapy product for commercial sale. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products, CDRH regulates companion diagnostics, and the Office of Combination Products, or OCP, issues classification and jurisdiction assignments for medical products. Specifically, OCP determines how
combination products, such as biologic/medical device combination products, will be regulated and which FDA Center or Lead Center (e.g., CBER or CDRH) will regulate the product. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion
of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also
has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing and chemistry,
manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and
genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology.
More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product
candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the trial is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA
Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the
NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its
quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.

any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the
FDA, unless the FDA places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA
allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review
process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA
authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate

at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical

and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or <I>in vitro</I> testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected
adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify
the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#146;s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully
within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an
unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated gene therapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with

potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research

candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability

biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant
deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will
be granted on a timely basis, if at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by
a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biological products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biological products. Fee
waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs,
unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA
submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information.
In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth
substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being
manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult
questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA
is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. </P>

The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an
applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory
criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the
FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring
additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may
either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product receives
regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain
contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of
any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product&#146;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs
to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA has agreed to certain review goals under PDUFA, and

subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests, or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides, additional information or clarification regarding information already

reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and
demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or
biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biological product as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the
marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that
the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other

The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing
treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict
a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical
benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving
accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the effect of the endpoint. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials,
which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A product may also be eligible for receipt of a
Breakthrough Therapy designation. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the FDA&#146;s review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions where &#147;preliminary clinical evidence indicates
that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.&#148; The designation of a drug as a
Breakthrough Therapy provides the same benefits as are available under the Fast Track program, as well as intensive FDA guidance on the product&#146;s development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and
Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Combination

products where two or more separate products are packaged together (e.g., drug and device products); or a product packaged separately but intended for use only with an approved, individually specified product, where both are required to achieve the
intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product, the labeling of the individually specified product would need to be changed (e.g., to reflect a change in intended use). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Regulation of Companion Diagnostics </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the FD&amp;C Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among
other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import,
and post-market surveillance. Companion diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FD&amp;C Act. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and PMA approval. We anticipate that the companion diagnostic tests we are developing will be subject to
the PMA approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data,
including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and
clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers
to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA
will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not
favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may
also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval
may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We and our third-party collaborators who may develop our companion diagnostics will work cooperatively to generate the data required for
submission with the PMA application, and will remain in close contact with the CDRH to ensure that any changes in requirements are incorporated into the development plans. We anticipate that, as was the case in our meetings to date, future meetings
with the FDA with regard to MYDICAR and its companion diagnostic product candidate will include representatives from both CBER and CDRH to ensure that the BLA and PMA submissions are coordinated to enable the FDA to conduct a parallel review of both
submissions. On August&nbsp;6, 2014, the FDA issued a guidance document addressing the development and approval process for &#147;In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.&#148; According to the guidance, for novel products such as MYDICAR, the PMA for
a companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved contemporaneously with the biological product. We believe our programs for the development of our companion diagnostics are consistent with the guidance. On April&nbsp;23, 2014, the FDA
issued for comment a draft guidance document proposing a new, voluntary program for certain medical devices that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for life threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions that
are subject to PMA applications, referred to as the Expedited Access PMA or EAP program. The draft guidance includes references to companion diagnostics as potentially being eligible for the EAP program if the stated criteria are satisfied. The
proposed program is designed to help patients have more timely access to these medical devices by expediting their development, assessment and review, while preserving the statutory standard of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for
premarket approval. For example, as part of the proposed EAP program, on a case-by-case basis, the FDA may, where appropriate, allow a sponsor to provide less manufacturing information in their PMA application. While this draft guidance is not yet
finalized, we believe that the review and approval of our companion diagnostic may qualify for and benefit from elements of the EAP program if the program is ultimately implemented as proposed. </P>

time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and
commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and
documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting
of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing
process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to
the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#146;s tests performed on the lot. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the
regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. </P>

withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an
applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters,
product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement

withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications

and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic
products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party
reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to restrict access or not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results

provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If
granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing
authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European

expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings or strategic collaborations. We have not completed pivotal clinical trials for any product candidate and it will be several years, if ever, before we have a product
candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product candidates have received approval, and our ability to
achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our product candidates in those markets. </P>

condition caused by the inability of the heart to relax normally between contractions, if supported by the CUPID 2 results. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will enable us to fund our operations for at least the
next 12 months. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other
third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory
approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates and companion diagnostic, as well as to further develop MYDICAR for additional indications. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek
additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic goals that require additional capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are highly dependent on the success of MYDICAR and we may not be able to successfully obtain regulatory or marketing approval for, or successfully
commercialize, this product candidate. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have expended significant time, resources and effort on the development of
MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. Although we are preparing for the development of MYDICAR for the treatment of HFpEF and AVF and preclinical activities relating to our small molecule
product candidates and our stem cell factor gene therapy program, our ability to generate product revenues and to achieve commercial success will initially depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for
and then successfully commercialize MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF in the United States and the European Economic Area, or EEA. Before we can market and sell MYDICAR in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, we will need to commence and
complete additional clinical trials, manage clinical and manufacturing activities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA in the United States, from the EMA in the EEA, and from other foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions
for both MYDICAR and its companion diagnostic, obtain commercial manufacturing supply, build a commercial marketing organization or enter into a commercial marketing collaboration with a third party, and in some jurisdictions, obtain reimbursement
authorization, among other things. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the necessary clinical trials and/or obtain regulatory approvals and sufficient commercial manufacturing supply for MYDICAR or its companion
diagnostic. To date, no gene therapy product has ever been approved in the United States. If we do not receive regulatory approvals, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we obtain
regulatory approvals, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of MYDICAR. If we fail to successfully commercialize MYDICAR, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business and our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2015, we plan to un-blind the
data from our ongoing CUPID 2 trial. If the results of the CUPID 2 trial are not positive, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, patients in the CUPID 2 trial are being followed for a total of five years in
an extended long-term follow up period, which period will continue through February 2019. Even if the initial un-blinded results from the CUPID 2 trial are viewed positively, it is possible that negative consequences of the treatment could be
observed in the future, which could adversely impact the regulatory and commercial prospects of MYDICAR. Any significant set-back regarding, or the failure of, MYDICAR will have a significant negative impact on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>MYDICAR is based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently
obtaining regulatory approval. At the moment, no gene therapy product has been approved in the United States and only one gene therapy product has been approved in Europe. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have primarily concentrated our research and development efforts on our lead product candidate, MYDICAR, for the treatment of HFrEF, and our
future success is highly dependent on the successful development of this product candidate. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our product candidates will not cause significant delays or
unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. In addition, our product development program is dependent on the development and commercialization of a required companion diagnostic by us or by third party collaborators.
Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and those diagnostic tools must independently be cleared or approved by the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities before we may commercialize our product candidates.
We may also experience delays in finalizing our commercial manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners or producing clinical trial supplies, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing
our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory
authorities, and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory
approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. For example, the FDA has required us to conduct a safety
and efficacy trial of patients with pre-existing NAbs to the AAV-based vectors used by MYDICAR as well as a viral shedding trial to determine the dissemination of our MYDICAR vector particles into the environment. At the moment, no gene therapy
product has been approved in the United States and only one gene therapy product, uniQure&#146;s Glybera, which received marketing authorization from the EMA in 2012, has been approved in Europe, which makes it difficult to determine how long it
will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either the United States or Europe. Prior product candidate approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA or EMA may require for MYDICAR
approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. Gene
therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146; Recombinant
DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its
initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an investigational new drug application, or IND, on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review. Also, before a clinical trial can begin at an NIH-funded institution, that institution&#146;s
institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products
conducted by others may cause the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities to change the requirements for approval of any of our gene therapy-based product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These regulatory review committees and advisory groups, and the new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process,
require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval
limitations or restrictions. As we advance the development of our gene therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be
required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approvals necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate
sufficient product revenue to maintain our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Failure to successfully validate, commercialize and obtain regulatory approval for our
companion diagnostic could delay or prevent commercialization of MYDICAR. Devices used in the administration of MYDICAR may also require labeling changes and result in delays for the commercialization of MYDICAR. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A key element of our strategy is to screen out patients with certain amounts of pre-existing NAbs to the AAV1 viral vector used as an active
ingredient in MYDICAR. We have developed a companion diagnostic that will be used to help us better identify those patients who may benefit from treatment with MYDICAR. Although we are currently exploring the feasibility of using a plasma exchange
procedure to remove AAV1 NAbs from advanced heart failure patients to enable their treatment with MYDICAR, the FDA may not permit this procedure to be investigated in certain patient populations, and such a procedure may ultimately prove to be
unsafe, ineffective or cost prohibitive, and we cannot predict with certainty when, if ever, such a procedure could successfully be implemented on a broad basis or whether such a procedure would be covered for reimbursement by third-party payors. We
will be dependent on such companion diagnostic, both during our clinical trials and in connection with any future commercialization of MYDICAR for HFrEF or for other indications. We expect that we will enter into a strategic alliance with a third
party for the automation and commercialization of our </P>

companion diagnostic. We and any of our future collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing the companion diagnostic for commercial application, including issues in relation to
automation, selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, critical reagents, or clinical validation of such companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices and require separate
regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization. In the case of MYDICAR, we anticipate that the FDA will require approval of the companion diagnostic under a medical device pre-market approval, or PMA, application prior to, or
concurrently with, approval and commercialization of MYDICAR, which could delay our ability to commercialize both products. If we, or any of our future collaborators, fail to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic or are delayed in
receiving such approval, our ability to commercialize MYDICAR would be delayed until such time as regulatory approval is obtained. In addition, our future collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the
companion diagnostic, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostic in the clinical community. MYDICAR and certain of the off-the-shelf legally marketed administration components used in the
cardiac catheterization laboratory may be regulated as combination products. These include, but are not limited to, regulated products where two or more separate products are packaged together (e.g., drug and device products); or a product packaged
separately but intended for use only with an approved, individually specified product where both are required to achieve the intended use of the proposed product. We are in discussions with FDA regarding pre-commercial testing, packaging and
labeling requirements for the administration devices and it is possible that MYDICAR may include labeling that specifies certain administration products or product attributes, and the labeling of some of the administration products may need to be
changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, which revisions could delay our ability to commercialize MYDICAR. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may find it difficult to

qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates as
well as completion of required follow-up periods. If patients are unwilling to participate in our gene therapy trials because of negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries or for other reasons, including
competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed. In addition, if there are delays in accumulating the
required number of clinical events in trials where clinical events are a primary endpoint, there may be delays in completing the trial. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the
effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patient enrollment and completion of clinical trials

Poland, the prevalence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs is significantly higher. These antibodies neutralize the effectiveness of AAV-based vectors, such as MYDICAR, and although we are able to prescreen for the presence of these antibodies, the high

interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development.

double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MYDICAR to reduce the frequency of, and/or delay of, heart failure-related hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF, may not be deemed to be a
pivotal trial or may not provide sufficient support for a BLA or MAA submission. Although our CUPID 1 trial met its primary safety and efficacy endpoints at six months for high-dose MYDICAR versus placebo and the safety profile from this trial was
very favorable, it is still possible that, even if we achieve favorable results in the CUPID 2 trial, the FDA may require us to conduct one or more additional clinical trials, possibly involving a larger sample size or a different clinical trial
design, particularly if the FDA does not find the results from the CUPID 2 trial to be sufficiently persuasive to support a BLA submission. For example, the FDA advised us in October 2013 that the number of subjects in our proposed safety database
may be an issue to be considered in review of our BLA submission. In addition, the FDA may not accept the use of the mITT analysis population for the CUPID 2 primary analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. </P>

failure population, and no untoward effects attributable to MYDICAR are observed, a safety database of approximately 205 to 230 MYDICAR-treated subjects may be sufficient to assess safety and allow acceptance of an MAA for MYDICAR for the treatment

treatment of HFrEF. If the FDA or the EMA requires additional studies, we will incur additional costs and delays in the marketing approval process. Even if additional studies are not required for regulatory approval, we will need to expend more
resources than we currently have available in order to commercialize MYDICAR. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and the EMA may have divergent opinions on the elements necessary for a successful BLA and MAA, respectively, which may cause us
to alter our development, regulatory and/or commercialization strategies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with MYDICAR may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or
events. Although extensive preclinical safety and biodistribution testing conducted on MYDICAR and other AAV vectors, including the CUPID 1 trial of MYDICAR for HFrEF and data from previous clinical trials of other AAV vectors, suggests that MYDICAR
will be well tolerated, known adverse side effects that could present with treatment with AAV vectors include an immunologic reaction to the capsid protein or gene at early time points after administration. In previous clinical trials involving AAV
viral vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced serious adverse events, including the development of a T-cell mediated immune response against the vector capsid proteins. As we make plans to initiate a phase 1/2 MYDICAR trial at a dose
2.5-fold higher than previously studied, a T-cell mediated immune response could become more of a risk. If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect, or other adverse events, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our
product candidates. In addition, theoretical adverse side effects of AAV vectors include replication and spread of the virus to other parts of the body and insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the insertion of a gene near a gene
that is important in cell growth or division results in uncontrolled cell division, which could potentially enhance the risk of malignant transformation or cancer. Potential procedure-related events are similar to those associated with standard

our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The
product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and

authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy
during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of

by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of MYDICAR outside of the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and
marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates in those countries and, if
applicable, any required companion diagnostic. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical
studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products,
if approved, is also subject to approval. While we may decide to submit an MAA to the EMA for approval in the EEA, obtaining such approval is a lengthy and expensive process and the EMA has its own procedures for approval of product candidates. Even
if a product is approved, the FDA or the EMA, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or
reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and the EEA also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining
foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical
trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one
country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or
receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of MYDICAR will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected. </P>

appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with

SPA from the FDA for a potential Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of MYDICAR. The FDA&#146;s SPA process creates a written agreement between the sponsoring company and the FDA regarding clinical trial design and other clinical trial issues, such as
the trial endpoints, that can be used to support approval of a product candidate. The SPA is intended to provide assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed and the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, the data may
serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA or BLA. However, an SPA is not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, an SPA agreement is not
binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, if other new scientific concerns regarding product candidate safety or efficacy arise or if the sponsoring company fails to
comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocols. Moreover, an SPA does not address all of the variables and details that may go into planning for or conducting a clinical trial, and changes in the protocol for a clinical trial can invalidate an
SPA or require that the FDA agree in writing to the modified protocol. In addition, while an SPA addresses the requirements for submission of a BLA, the results of the related clinical trial may not support FDA approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CUPID 2 is similar in design to the SPA Phase 3 protocol and uses the same primary efficacy endpoint, except that CUPID 2 will use an mITT
approach for the primary analysis population as opposed to an intent to treat approach and has a significantly smaller number of subjects. However, we believe that the FDA&#146;s agreement of the SPA regarding the trial endpoint is relevant to the
CUPID 2 trial. Experience from the CUPID 2 trial has informed the design of a Phase 3 trial and we believe that significant changes to the protocol approved under the SPA are required, which would necessitate written agreement by FDA to ensure
binding agreement of the protocol. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to our Reliance on Third Parties </B></P>

ICH&#146;s (the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) GCPs for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and reported
results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities,
enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we, our principal investigators or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical
trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical
trials did not comply with GCPs. In addition, our future clinical trials will require a sufficient number of patients to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations
or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our CROs are not our employees, and we are therefore unable to directly monitor whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to
our clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities that could harm our
competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to
our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates.
If any such event were to occur, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. </P>

do so on commercially reasonable terms. Further, switching or adding additional CROs involves additional costs and requires management time and focus. We have recently entered into a contract with a new CRO for new clinical trials. In addition,
there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs,
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. </P>

clinical trials, Lonza may not perform as agreed, may be unable to comply with GMP requirements and with FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements or may terminate its agreement with us. If Lonza is unable to manufacture MYDICAR drug substance
in a timely manner, encounters manufacturing difficulties, or otherwise fails to comply with its contractual obligations and we are required to switch to a new manufacturer, we expect that our clinical development timeline would be delayed by at
least one year. Because of the complex nature of our product candidates, Lonza, Novasep, or any other manufacturer with whom we may enter into an agreement, may not be able to manufacture our product candidates at a cost or in quantities or on
timelines necessary for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. If we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we will be required to establish large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities, relying on one or
more third parties, and there is no guarantee that any such third parties will be able to do this in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, in the event that our product development pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for
clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. We have minimal experience manufacturing pharmaceutical or biological products on a commercial scale and our potential suppliers, including Lonza and Novasep, will have to construct and validate
new commercial manufacturing facilities and obtain regulatory approvals for the facilities before being able to produce MYDICAR, and there can be no assurance that they will succeed in doing so. </P>

Biologics, Inc., or Lonza, pursuant to which we and Lonza agreed to initiate detailed design planning for the potential construction of a new commercial viral therapeutics facility in Portsmouth, New Hampshire for the manufacture of MYDICAR drug
substance (AAV1/SERCA2a), and in exchange for an upfront reservation fee payable by us to Lonza, Lonza agreed to reserve, for a period of time extendable on payment of specified reservation extension fees, the capital, property and labor resources
necessary to enable the initiation of construction of the facility within 75 days of receipt of notice of our decision to initiate construction of the facility and commit to a long-term supply arrangement for MYDICAR, or the construction

it will be completed on this timeframe, or at all. Our decision as to whether to exercise the construction trigger may be impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, the outcome of our CUPID 2 trial of MYDICAR, our expectations
regarding clinical trial requirements and development timelines, and our perception of the prospects for commercialization of MYDICAR. Even if we view the results of our CUPID 2 trial as sufficiently favorable to support a decision to exercise the
construction trigger, our ability to do so may be limited by a number of additional factors, including our ability to obtain financing on terms sufficient to fund our financial obligations under the agreement following exercise of the construction
trigger. In addition, under our loan and security agreement with Hercules, we will be required to either obtain the consent of Hercules prior to exercising the construction trigger or pay off our outstanding loan under the agreement, and there is no
guarantee that we will be able to do either within the timeframe available to us to exercise the construction trigger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2015 we

the Novasep Facility. We will need to decide whether to terminate the agreement or proceed with very substantial commitments to pay for the design, construction activities and operation of the manufacturing facility, including the purchase of
commercial lots of MYDICAR on a &#147;take or pay&#148; basis, which means that we must commit to a minimum amount of purchases of MYDICAR through the end of 2018 or (or 2019 if we choose to have the facility be dedicated solely to MYDICAR drug

third parties to commercialize our product candidates and companion diagnostic outside of the United States. We intend to build an internal sales and marketing organization for the commercialization of MYDICAR in the United States. However, we will
also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for our product candidates and companion diagnostic in the United States and other geographies where we obtain marketing approval. We may need to give up substantial rights to MYDICAR in

activities for MYDICAR at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do
not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring MYDICAR to market or generate product revenue. We could enter into arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be ideal and we may be required
to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or our companion diagnostic or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not

addition, there are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and
time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or
unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. </P>

such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, changing standards of care, achieving favorable hospital formulary status, third-party payor reimbursement standards, ability of patients to meet co-payment amounts, patient and
physician preferences, and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge. We believe that approximately 60% of such potential patients in the United States will be ineligible for treatment with MYDICAR due to the presence of
pre-existing AAV1 NAbs which will neutralize the effectiveness of AAV-based vectors such as MYDICAR. In other countries, such as Poland, the prevalence of pre-existing AAV-resistant antibodies is significantly higher. In addition, just one exposure
to an AAV-based treatment such as MYDICAR may cause a patient to produce NAbs. Furthermore, other pharmaceutical companies could develop and receive approval for new AAV-based treatments which could increase the number of patients that exhibit NAbs.
We estimate that there are over 350,000 heart failure patients in the United States alone that would be eligible for MYDICAR treatment upon launch, if approved; however, if the potential eligible patient population is lower than we anticipate, or if
considerably more than 60% of potential patients exhibit NAbs, it could significantly and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>

demonstrated to be &#147;highly similar,&#148; or &#147;biosimilar,&#148; to or &#147;interchangeable&#148; with an FDA-approved biological product. This new pathway could allow competitors to reference data from biological products already approved
after 12 years from the time of approval in the United States. In addition, companies may be developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with our products. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars
referencing our products, our products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of our applicable patent rights could also trigger
competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, as a result of the expiration or

care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage
insurers and other third-party payors. Co-pay amounts under Medicare (generally 20% of the cost of the treatment for patients without supplemental insurance) or other third-party payor systems may be a substantial hindrance to certain patients&#146;
ability to pay for MYDICAR treatment. In addition, the market for MYDICAR and any of our other product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors&#146; formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payors
provide coverage and reimbursement and patients&#146; ability to make copayments, if applicable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payors, whether foreign or
domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products exists among third-party
payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our
products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and reimbursement will be obtained. In many foreign countries, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country, and
we may fail to obtain such reimbursement approvals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, decisions about Medicare coverage and reimbursement for new
medicines are made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for administering the Medicare program. Private payors and other government payors
often follow CMS&#146;s policies to a substantial degree, making the Medicare determinations particularly significant. It remains uncertain what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is
no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Similarly, outside the United States, we may not succeed in obtaining reimbursement approval from the relevant regulatory authorities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost
alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required CMS to reduce the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee
Schedule, or CLFS, by 2% in 2013, which in turn serves as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. In addition, CMS announced that it will bundle the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital
outpatient setting beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">More recently, on April&nbsp;1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of
2014, or PAMA, was signed to law, which, among other things, significantly alters the current payment methodology under the CLFS. Under the new law, starting January&nbsp;1, 2016 and every three years thereafter (or annually in the case of advanced
diagnostic lab tests), applicable clinical laboratories must report laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes during a time period to be defined by future regulations. The reported data
must include the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each test that was paid by each private payor (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans
and Medicaid managed care organizations). Beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period. The payment rate will
apply to clinical laboratory diagnostic tests furnished by a hospital laboratory if the test is separately paid under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system. Additionally, PAMA overrules reforms included in the 2014 final rule for the
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule that called for a process to permit CMS to adjust payments under the CLFS to account for technological changes in tools, machines, supplies, labor, instruments, skills, techniques and devices by which laboratory tests
are produced and used beginning in 2015. Levels of reimbursement may be impacted by these initiatives and other current and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors in a manner that

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market
regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of
medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix
their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in
markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party coverage and reimbursement for MYDICAR or any of our other product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not
be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets and may vary substantially from our current assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Healthcare reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended
by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which has the potential to substantially change health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the U.S.
pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under
the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals
enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness
research. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was
enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at
least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to
providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American
Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including physicians, hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations
period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and
state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. </P>

problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry. There is
currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical
development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms, or at all, given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In
addition, failure to succeed in preclinical studies or clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may
impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Furthermore, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged
proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output. </P>

management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our
operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital
expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to

numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and
flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of
contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under
applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of
these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be
held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental
laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply
with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result

result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and a decreased ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, which is
undergoing a continued severe economic crisis. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm
our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. </P>

the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to
manufacture our vectors, our product candidates and our companion diagnostic and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any
disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of
our product candidates and any related companion diagnostics could be delayed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Interruptions in the supply of product or inventory loss may

addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in these intermediate products not complying with stability requirements or specifications. Most of our product candidates must be stored and transported at
temperatures within a certain range. If these environmental conditions deviate, our product candidates&#146; remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their efficacy and safety could become adversely affected, making them no longer suitable for

operations, financial condition and prospects. A majority of our management operates in our principal executive offices located in San Diego, California. If our San Diego offices were affected by a natural or man-made disaster, particularly those
that are characteristic of the region, such as wildfires and earthquakes, or other business interruption, our ability to manage our domestic and foreign operations could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities
of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity
plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity
plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We currently rely, and intend to rely in the future, on our third-party manufacturer, Lonza, to produce our
clinical supply of MYDICAR. Our ability to obtain supply of MYDICAR could be disrupted, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the operations of Lonza were affected by a man-made or
natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact of any such events on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure is unknown. For more information regarding our manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, see

confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our product candidates and companion diagnostic. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can
be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates and companion diagnostic in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance
that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue
and even if such patents cover our product candidates or companion diagnostic, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are
unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or companion diagnostic or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes
could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the patent

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Several patent applications covering our product candidates and companion diagnostic have been filed recently. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth
of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights
necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates or companion diagnostic that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate and
companion diagnostic under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we
were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate or companion diagnostic. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by a third
party to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years
after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates and companion diagnostic are obtained, once the patent life has expired
for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on
trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidates and
companion diagnostic discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology
and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and
confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems,
agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and
any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other
confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized
disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse
against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether
to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA&#146;s disclosure policies may
change in the future, if at all. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in
protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no
guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. </P>

diligence obligations, payment of milestones and/or royalties and other obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in
which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. Additionally, several of our existing license agreements are sublicenses from a third party who is not the original licensor of the intellectual property at issue. Under
these agreements, we must rely on our licensor to comply with their obligations under the primary license agreements under which such third party obtained rights in the applicable intellectual property, where we may have no relationship with the
original licensor of such rights. If our licensors fail to comply with their obligations under these upstream license agreements, the original third-party licensor may have the right to terminate the original license, which may terminate our
sublicense. If this were to occur, we would no longer have rights to the applicable intellectual property unless we are able to secure our own direct license with the owner of the relevant rights, which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a
substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences,
oppositions and <I>inter partes</I> review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by
third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates and our companion diagnostic. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates
and companion diagnostic may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third parties may assert that we
are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of
our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or companion
diagnostic may infringe, or which such third parties claim are infringed by the use of our technologies. If any third-party patents are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover any aspect of the manufacturing process for any of our product
candidates or companion diagnostic, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product candidate or companion diagnostic, including the formulation or method of use of such product candidate or companion diagnostic, the
holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate or companion diagnostic unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. In any such case, such a license

expenditure, which could force us to cease commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or the companion diagnostic, or some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. In addition, in any such proceeding, we

or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. A third-party defendant may also request post grant review or <I>inter partes</I> review by the U.S.
PTO of any patent we assert. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to

prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.

various organizations and academic institutions on the advancement of our gene therapy and small molecule platforms and companion diagnostic, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by
entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or
disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third
parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in
violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor&#146;s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position

in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure
patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and
development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets,

third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate or companion diagnostic, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable.
In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous ground upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent Third
parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions
(e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or related companion diagnostics. The outcome following legal assertions of
invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during
prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Such a loss of patent
protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby

on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United
States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent
owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on
decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents
that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the recent case, <I>Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,</I> the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. While we do not believe that
any of the patents owned or licensed by us will be found invalid based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. PTO may impact the value of our patents. </P>

intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal
and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the
United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have
patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.

controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior

grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2013 plan will automatically increase on January&nbsp;1 of each year by 5% of the total number
of shares of our common stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. In addition, we may grant or provide
for the grant of rights to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our 2013 employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically increase on January&nbsp;1 of
each calendar year by the lesser of 1% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year and 384,307 shares, subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the
size of the increase in any given year. Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 plan and ESPP each year. Increases in the number of shares available for future grant or purchase may result
in additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future grant inducement grants to prospective employees and consultants, which may result in further dilution and cause our stock

securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
management&#146;s attention and resources, which could harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other

corporation undergoes an &#147;ownership change,&#148; generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation&#146;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards
and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have determined that several ownership changes have occurred since our inception and have reduced our deferred tax asset
accordingly. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset
U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We do not intend

our initial public offering of our common stock. Pursuant to the registration statement, we registered the offer and sale of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock. On February&nbsp;4, 2014, we sold 5,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public
offering price of $8.00 per share and on February&nbsp;27, 2014, we sold 825,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares.
The offering has terminated. The sole book-running managing underwriter for the offering was Barclays Capital Inc. After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs paid by us of $6.3 million, the net proceeds from the offering
were approximately $44.3 million. No offering expenses were paid or are payable, directly or indirectly, to our directors or officers, to persons owning 10% or more of any class of our equity securities, or to any of our affiliates. </P>

securities, pending their use. Our cash requirements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 were primarily met with sources of liquidity available to us at December&nbsp;31, 2013, prior to our initial public offering. As of December&nbsp;31,
2014, we have used approximately $11.6 million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering. There has been no material change in the expected use of the net proceeds from our initial public offering as described in our final prospectus
filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424(b), except we intend to dedicate all or a portion of the net proceeds received by us from the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional shares to a trial of MYDICAR for the

biotechnology company with industry-leading expertise in the development of cardiovascular gene therapy. We apply our leadership position in the field of gene therapy and calcium dysregulation to develop novel therapies for diseases with high unmet
medical needs. Our therapeutic portfolio for diseases characterized by SERCA enzyme deficiency includes both gene therapies and small molecule compounds. We are evaluating our lead product candidate, MYDICAR, in a 250-patient randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled international Phase 2b trial in patients with heart failure for reduced ejection fraction or HFrEF (also referred to as systolic heart failure), which we refer to as CUPID 2. We completed enrollment of CUPID 2 in
February 2014, reached the primary analysis data cutoff in February 2015 and expect to unblind the data and announce results in late April 2015. If successful, these results, along with other studies, could form the basis for regulatory submissions
for approval with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA. We also plan to develop MYDICAR for additional indications, such as AVF maturation failure, and for the treatment of patients with

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical Trial Accruals </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our
obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may
result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of CROs and other third-party vendors.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our consolidated financial statements by matching those expenses
with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates
through discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust the rate of clinical trial expense
recognition if actual results differ from the estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect that our
estimates will be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting amounts that
are too high or too low for any particular period. Through December&nbsp;31, 2014, there had been no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot
assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Compensation expense for stock-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including employee stock options and employee stock
purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), represents the grant date fair value of the awards recognized over the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. For
stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for stock options granted to non-employees using the fair-value approach. These options are subject to periodic revaluation over
their vesting terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the fair value of our stock-based payment awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, (b)&nbsp;the expected volatility of our stock, (c)&nbsp;the expected term of the award and (d)&nbsp;the expected dividend yield. Until our recently
completed initial public offering, there was no public market for the trading of our common stock. Due to this fact and a lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the
historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and with
historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the
calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of
our employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S.&nbsp;Treasury
zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Net Operating Loss Carryforwards </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had federal and California tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $82.2 million and $77.0
million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 unless previously utilized, and the state net operating loss carryforwards have already begun to expire, and will continue to do so, unless utilized. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.3 million each. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2032, unless
previously utilized. The California research and development tax credit carryforwards are available indefinitely until utilized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
future utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited due to changes in ownership. In general, if we experience a greater than 50% aggregate change in ownership of certain significant stockholders or groups over a
three-year period, or a Section&nbsp;382 ownership change, utilization of our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code,
and similar state laws. The annual limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of such ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may
result in expiration of a portion of the pre-change net operating loss carryforwards before utilization and may be substantial. We completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, had occurred
since our formation through December&nbsp;31, 2014. Based upon the results of this study, we determined that several ownership changes had occurred and we reduced our deferred tax asset with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance
accordingly. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the remaining portion of the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards. We may also experience ownership
changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to
limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>JOBS Act </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;5, 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; can take
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section&nbsp;7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the
relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to certain conditions set forth in the
JOBS Act, as an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including without limitation, (1)&nbsp;providing an auditor&#146;s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (2)&nbsp;complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#146;s
report providing additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; until the earliest of (a)&nbsp;the last day of the
fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, (b)&nbsp;the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering, (c)&nbsp;the date on which we have
issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three years or (d)&nbsp;the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. </P>

$16.9&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase of approximately $5.7&nbsp;million was due primarily to an increase of $5.7 million in expenses during 2014 associated with the drug substance

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have incurred net losses each year since our inception and as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately
$146.4&nbsp;million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will
need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain through one or more public or private equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, strategic alliances and licensing or collaboration arrangements.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our inception through December&nbsp;31, 2014, we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity and debt
securities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately $84.9&nbsp;million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to
liquidity and capital preservation. Our initial public offering completed in February 2014 resulted in net proceeds to us of $44.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses payable by us, including $1.7
million in offering costs paid by us prior to December&nbsp;31, 2013. The outstanding principal and accrued interest thereon under our outstanding convertible promissory notes converted into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial
public offering. On July&nbsp;31, 2014, we entered into a Loan Agreement with Hercules under which we can borrow up to $25.0 million in two tranches. On August&nbsp;1, 2014, we borrowed the first tranche in the amount of $10.0 million and received
$9.6 million, net of fees. The second tranche of up to $15.0 million can be drawn at our option through June&nbsp;30, 2015 (amended from May&nbsp;31, 2015), subject to the satisfaction of certain funding conditions related to our clinical
development of MYDICAR. Our underwritten public offering completed in August 2014 resulted in net proceeds to us of $40.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses payable by us. </P>

MYDICAR and our companion diagnostic and commercialize MYDICAR or any of our other product candidates. At the same time, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, particularly as we continue the
research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates and companion diagnostic. We expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. In addition, subject to obtaining
regulatory approval of any of our product candidates and companion diagnostic, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need additional funding

investments to fund development activities, including commercial manufacturing capabilities, related to MYDICAR for the treatment of HFrEF, including patients with existing LVADs, AVF maturation failure, internal salaries and external costs related
to completion of our CUPID 2 trial and the remainder to fund working capital, including general operating expenses. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash
and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash
equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have interest rate exposure as
a result of our secured term loan with Hercules. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the outstanding principal amount of the term loan was $10.0 million. The outstanding principal under the loan accrues interest at a rate equal to the greater of
(i)&nbsp;8.25% plus the prime rate as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal minus 5.25%, and (ii)&nbsp;8.25%. Changes in the prime rate may therefore affect our interest expense associated with our secured term loan. </P>

the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the

Corporation (Celladon or the Company) was incorporated in California on December&nbsp;21, 2000 (inception) and reincorporated in Delaware in April 2012. The Company is a clinical-stage biotechnology with industry-leading expertise in the development
of cardiovascular gene therapy. The Company applies its leadership position in the field of gene therapy and calcium dysregulation to develop novel therapies for diseases with tremendous unmet medical needs and characterized by an underlying SERCA
enzyme deficiency. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to product development, raising

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The
preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements relate to the fair value of equity awards and clinical trial expense accruals. Although
these estimates are based on the Company&#146;s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates. </P>

Company completed its initial public offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $8.00 per share, which included the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 825,000 additional shares of common stock. The
Company received net proceeds of $44.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commission and offering expenses payable by the Company, including $1.7 million in offering costs paid by the Company prior to December&nbsp;31, 2013. In
connection with the initial public offering, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock, the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Company&#146;s outstanding convertible notes were
converted into shares of common stock and the unamortized debt discount related to the convertible notes was charged to expense, warrants to purchase shares of Series A-1 preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock, the
warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital, and the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to authorize 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock. See

recorded the net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During all periods presented, the Company did not record any material gains or losses from

available-for-sale. Investments with maturity dates greater than 12 months from the end of each reporting period are classified as long-term. Investment securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. A decline in the
market value of any investment security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary will result in an impairment charge to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. No such impairment charges were recorded for any
period presented. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, none of the investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the
related security as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method and are included in interest income. Interest income is recognized when earned. </P>

that assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. While the Company&#146;s current and historical operating losses and negative cash flows are

process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from its obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials.
The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. The
Company&#146;s objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in its financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the
progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. The Company determines accrual estimates through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service
providers as to the progress or state of consummation of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company
makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts
actually incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular
period. Through December&nbsp;31, 2014, there have been no material adjustments to the Company&#146;s prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. The Company&#146;s clinical trial accrual is dependent upon the timely and accurate
reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Preferred Stock Warrant Liability </B></P>

classified as a current liability at December&nbsp;31, 2013 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock is classified as temporary equity at December&nbsp;31, 2013 in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets instead of in stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) in accordance with authoritative guidance for the classification and measurement of redeemable securities. The warrants were recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with any changes in fair value being recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon completion of the Company&#146;s initial public
offering in February 2014, the warrants no longer required liability accounting and the then fair value of the warrant liability was reclassified into equity. </P>

stockholders by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. Dilutive common stock equivalents are comprised of convertible preferred stock and rights to acquire
convertible preferred stock (non-controlling interest), warrants for the purchase of common stock and options outstanding under the Company&#146;s stock option plans. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to

No.&nbsp;2014-10,&nbsp;<I>Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation</I>. ASU 2014-10 a) eliminates the
requirement for development stage entities to present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows and shareholder equity, b) amends Topic 275 to clarify that the risk and uncertainty disclosure requirements apply to
entities that have not commenced principal operations, c) eliminates the exception related to the sufficiency of equity at risk for development stage entities from the guidance on variable interest entities in paragraph 810-10-15-16 to increase
consistency in application of consolidated guidance across all entities and d) removes the definition of <I>development stage entities</I> from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification. The amendments in this Update are to be
applied retrospectively except for the clarification to Topic 275, which shall be applied prospectively. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014, with an option for
early adoption. The Company adopted this guidance prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The adoption of ASU&nbsp;2014-10 impacted disclosure only and did not have any impact on the Company&#146;s

payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying value of these financial instruments generally approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. Investment securities, warrant liabilities and redeemable non-controlling interest are recorded at
fair value. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, which is considered a Level 2 input, the Company believes that the fair value of its convertible debt approximates its carrying value. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair
value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits with third-party financial institutions
and highly liquid money market securities with original maturities at date of purchase of 90 days or less and are stated at cost which approximate fair value and are classified within the Level 1 designation discussed above. Marketable securities
are recorded at fair value, defined as the exit price in the principal market in which the Company would transact, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. Level&nbsp;2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or discounted cash flow techniques and include the Company&#146;s
investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper. Financial assets and liabilities that are measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, and are classified within the Level 3 designation, include the warrant liability and
redeemable non-controlling interest. None of the Company&#146;s non-financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. No transfers between levels have occurred during the periods presented. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cash equivalents measured at fair value as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, are all classified within Level 1. Below is a summary of assets

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2013, the Company entered into a note and warrant purchase agreement with certain existing investors for the sale of up to an
aggregate of $1,097,017 of convertible promissory notes (the 2013 Notes) and warrants exercisable to purchase shares of Series&nbsp;A-1 Preferred Stock (the 2013 Warrants). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The terms of the 2013 Notes provided for their automatic conversion (including accrued interest) upon a qualified initial public offering or
private placement of equity securities into common stock or other equity securities issued in such private placement at a conversion price per share equal to the initial public offering price or per share purchase price to investors in the private
placement. The conversion of the 2013 Notes in the event of a qualified initial public offering or private placement of equity was deemed to be the predominant settlement mechanism. As this predominant settlement mechanism provided for the
settlement of a fixed monetary amount in a variable number of equity instruments, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to recognize the 2013 Notes at fair value. The Company valued the 2013 Notes utilizing an estimated cost of debt for
comparable venture backed and mezzanine financings. The initial fair value of the 2013 Notes was approximately $1.0 million. Upon completion of the Company&#146;s initial public offering in February 2014, the 2013 Notes plus approximately $20,000 of
accrued interest automatically converted into 139,644 shares of common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 2013 Warrants were initially accounted for as
liabilities with subsequent changes in fair value recognized within the consolidated statement of operations. The Company determined that the initial fair value of the 2013 Warrants was $1.0 million. The fair value of the 2013 Warrants was derived
from the probability weighted expected return model the Company used to value its common stock. Upon completion of the Company&#146;s initial public offering in February 2014, the warrants no longer require liability accounting and the then fair
value of the warrant liability was reclassified into equity. The warrants also became exercisable for an aggregate of 231,821 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.61 per share. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial recognition of the 2013 Notes and 2013 Warrants at fair value resulted in a deemed dividend in the amount of $0.9 million that was
accounted for as additional net loss attributable to common stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Sublicense Agreement and Amended and Restated License Agreement with

June 2012, the Company entered into a sublicense agreement (the AmpliPhi Sublicense) with AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation (AmpliPhi), pursuant to which AmpliPhi sublicensed to the Company certain rights under a separate agreement which AmpliPhi
entered into in 2009 with the Trustees of University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). Under the terms of the AmpliPhi Sublicense, the Company obtained an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from AmpliPhi under certain UPenn patents related to AAV1 vectors for
the development, manufacture, use and sale of companion diagnostics to MYDICAR. In addition, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to companion
diagnostics under the agreement. The Company is currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. In consideration for the sublicense granted to the Company under the agreement, the Company paid to AmpliPhi a sublicense initiation fee of
$310,000, and the Company is obligated to pay to AmpliPhi an annual sublicense maintenance fee of $310,000. The Company is also required to pay to AmpliPhi a low single-digit percentage royalty based on net sales of any companion diagnostic covered
by a licensed patent sold by the Company, its affiliates or its sublicensees. The Company&#146;s royalty obligations continue on a companion diagnostic-by-companion diagnostic and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire
valid claim in a licensed patent covering the applicable companion diagnostic in such country. Finally, the Company is obligated to pay to AmpliPhi all royalty and milestone payments that become due and payable by AmpliPhi to UPenn under
AmpliPhi&#146;s agreement with UPenn as a result of the Company&#146;s exercise of the sublicense granted under the Company&#146;s agreement with AmpliPhi, including a low single-digit tiered percentage royalty on net sales of any companion
diagnostic sold by the Company, its affiliates or its sublicensees, which royalty is separate from and in addition to the royalty payable to AmpliPhi described above, and up to an aggregate of $850,000 in potential milestone payments per product
covered by the licensed patents. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has recorded research and development expense related to sublicense fees under the agreement of $0.3 million, $0.3 million and
$0.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Through December&nbsp;31, 2014, no milestone obligations were incurred under the agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Amended and Restated License Agreement </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company entered into an amended and restated license agreement with AmpliPhi concurrently with the AmpliPhi Sublicense that both amended
the terms of the license agreement which the Company entered into with AmpliPhi in 2009 and terminated its manufacturing agreement with AmpliPhi which the Company entered into in 2009. Under the agreement, the Company obtained an exclusive,
worldwide license under certain patents and know-how related to AmpliPhi&#146;s AAV vector and manufacturing technology for the development, manufacture, use and sale of MYDICAR. In addition, the Company has agreed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to meet certain diligence milestones with respect to the development and commercialization of at least one product covered by the UPenn patent rights licensed to AmpliPhi by UPenn under the Company&#146;s agreement with UPenn. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. During the term of the agreement, the Company is not obligated to
make annual license or maintenance payments, but is obligated to pay to AmpliPhi all royalty and milestone payments that become due and payable by AmpliPhi to UPenn under&nbsp;AmpliPhi&#146;s agreement with UPenn as a result of the Company&#146;s
exercise of the sublicense granted under the Company&#146;s agreement with AmpliPhi. This includes a low single-digit tiered percentage royalty on net sales of MYDICAR and any other product covered by the licensed patents sold by the Company, its
affiliates or its sublicensees, and up to $850,000 in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones related to MYDICAR and any other product covered by the licensed patents. Through December&nbsp;31,
2014, no milestone obligations were incurred under the agreement. The agreement does not provide either party with termination rights and does not have a provision for expiration or automatic termination. In addition, the Company paid
$3.2&nbsp;million in exchange for certain intangible assets associated with the license agreement that the Company acquired from AmpliPhi in June 2012, which were expensed as in-process research and development during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Exclusive Patent License with the Regents of the University of Minnesota </B></P>

it obtained an exclusive license to UMinn&#146;s joint ownership interest in a patent application related to screening technology for isolation of small molecule modulators of SERCA enzymes. The agreement does not encompass a manufacturing
agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has agreed to meet certain performance milestones under the agreement, the deadline for which may be extended at

Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (as agent and as a lender, and together with Hercules Technology III, L.P., the Lenders) under which the Company may borrow up to $25.0 million in two tranches (the Loan). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company borrowed the first tranche of $10.0 million on August&nbsp;1, 2014 and paid a
facility charge to the Lenders of $150,000 in addition to $37,500 previously paid to the Lenders as a commitment fee. The Company plans to use the proceeds of the Loan to provide additional funding for the development of MYDICAR, for other
development programs in its pipeline and for general corporate purposes. The second tranche of up to $15.0 million can be drawn through June&nbsp;30, 2015 (amended from May&nbsp;31, 2015), but only if the Company has provided the Lenders with notice
that data from the Company&#146;s Phase 2b clinical trial for MYDICAR supports the continued development of MYDICAR for its Breakthrough Therapy designation to either a Phase 3 clinical trial or for registration for approval, as reasonably
determined by the Company&#146;s senior management and board of directors (the Milestone). Upon funding of the second tranche of the Loan, the Company will be required to pay a facility charge to the Lenders of $100,000. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The interest rate for each tranche will be calculated at a rate equal to the greater of either (i)&nbsp;8.25% plus the prime rate as reported
from time to time in The Wall Street Journal minus 5.25%, and (ii)&nbsp;8.25%. Payments under the Loan Agreement are interest only until August&nbsp;1, 2015 (which will be extended until February&nbsp;1, 2016 if the Company achieves the Milestone on
or before June&nbsp;30, 2015) (the Amortization Date) followed by equal monthly payments of principal and interest through the scheduled maturity date on February&nbsp;1, 2018 (the Loan Maturity Date). In addition, a final payment equal to
$1,750,000 will be due at such time as the Loan is prepaid or becomes due and payable as specified in the Loan Agreement. The Company&#146;s obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of its assets,
excluding its intellectual property but including the proceeds from the sale, licensing or disposition of its intellectual property. The Company&#146;s intellectual property is also subject to customary negative covenants. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the Company prepays the loan prior to maturity, it will pay the Lenders a prepayment charge, based on a percentage of the then outstanding
principal balance, equal to 1.5% if the prepayment occurs prior to the Amortization Date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to certain conditions and limitations
set forth in the Loan Agreement, including ownership limitations of the Lenders, the Company has the right to convert up&nbsp;to $3.0&nbsp;million of scheduled principal installments of the Loan into shares of the Company&#146;s common stock,
provided such shares must be freely tradable. The number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion would be equal to the number determined by dividing (x)&nbsp;the principal amount to be paid in shares of common stock by
(y)&nbsp;$16.33. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants (affirmative and negative) of the
Company, including restrictive covenants that limit the Company&#146;s ability to: incur additional indebtedness; encumber the collateral securing the Loan; acquire, own or make investments; repurchase or redeem stock or other equity securities;
declare or pay any cash dividend or make a cash distribution on any class of stock or other equity interest; transfer a material portion of the Company&#146;s assets; acquire other businesses; and merge or consolidate with or into any other business
organization. The Loan Agreement does not however include any financial maintenance covenants. The Loan Agreement also includes standard events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, a
material impairment in the perfection or priority of the Lenders&#146; security interest or in the value of the collateral, and events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an
additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding Loan, and the Lenders may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as are set forth in the Loan Agreement. </P>

Initially, the ESPP authorizes the issuance of 165,732&nbsp;shares of common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to the Company&#146;s employees or to employees of any of the Company&#146;s designated affiliates. The number of shares of common
stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on January&nbsp;1 of each calendar year, from January&nbsp;1, 2015 through January&nbsp;1, 2023 by the least of (1)&nbsp;1% of the total number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock
outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, (2)&nbsp;384,307 shares, or (3)&nbsp;a number determined by the Company&#146;s board of directors that is less than (1)&nbsp;and&nbsp;(2). During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had federal and California net operating loss (NOL)
carryforwards of approximately $82.2&nbsp;million and $77.0&nbsp;million, respectively. The federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 unless previously utilized, and the state NOL carryforwards have already begun to expire, and will
continue to do so, unless utilized. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had federal and state research tax credits each of $1.3 million. The federal research tax credits begin to expire in 2032 unless previously utilized. The California research
credit will carry forward indefinitely until utilized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Utilization of the NOL and research tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a
substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership changes may limit
the amount of NOL and research tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an &#147;ownership change&#148; as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code results from a
transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, had occurred from the
Company&#146;s formation through December&nbsp;31, 2014. Based upon this study, the Company determined that several ownership changes had occurred. Accordingly, the Company has reduced its deferred tax assets related to the federal and state NOL
carryforwards and the federal research tax credit carryforwards that are anticipated to expire unused as a result of these ownership changes. These tax attributes have been excluded from the deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction in the
valuation allowance with no net effect on income tax expense or the effective tax rate. Future ownership changes may further limit the Company&#146;s ability to utilize its remaining tax attributes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 740-10 <I>Income Taxes</I>, relating to accounting for

March&nbsp;20, 2015, the Company entered into a Development, Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the &#147;Manufacturing Agreement&#148;) with Novasep, Inc. (&#147;Novasep&#148;) which superseded the Letter Agreement dated December&nbsp;19, 2014 by
and between the Company and Novasep. Under the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement, the parties agreed to continue the work initiated under the Letter Agreement, including the work necessary to prepare for the potential manufacture of MYDICAR drug
substance (AAV1/SERCA2a) at the facilities of Novasep&#146;s affiliate Henogen in Europe (the &#147;Novasep Facility&#148;). Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement (and as previously agreed in the Letter Agreement), in exchange for payments from
the Company to Novasep totaling up to &#128;4,750,000, Novasep agreed to (i)&nbsp;conduct the engineering design work for facility modifications that would be necessary for the manufacture of MYDICAR drug substance, (ii)&nbsp;undertake initial
process and analytical transfer and initial scale-up work in support of such potential future commercial manufacturing of MYDICAR drug substance, and (iii)&nbsp;allocate the resources and capacity necessary for the foregoing activities. The parties
have also agreed to proceed with the additional process transfer, engineering/construction, scale-up and development activities necessary for future production of MYDICAR drug substance in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices
(&#147;GMP&#148;), and agreed to terms of a commercial supply arrangement with a term through at least December&nbsp;31, 2018, with extension options through 2020 in favor of the Company. The Company has the right to terminate the Manufacturing
Agreement, exercisable for a specified period of time following the un-blinding of the data from the Company&#146;s Phase 2b clinical trial of MYDICAR (CUPID 2), if the Company concludes in good faith that the CUPID 2 data is such that the Company
does not require production of MYDICAR drug substance at the Novasep Facility. The Company expects to un-blind the data from the CUPID 2 trial in late April 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unless the Company exercises the post CUPID 2 data termination right described above, the Company will be obligated to (i)&nbsp;fund
Novasep&#146;s modifications to the Novasep Facility through time- and event-triggered milestone payments, (ii)&nbsp;make additional payments for the development services to be performed by Novasep, and (iii)&nbsp;commit to purchase a specified
number of batches of MYDICAR drug substance (or make minimum payments with respect to any such batches that are not purchased) through 2018 (if the Company elects that the Novasep Facility be operated as a multi-product facility) or through 2019 (if
the Company elects to have the Novasep Facility dedicated to MYDICAR drug substance production during the term of the Manufacturing Agreement). </P>

(i)&nbsp;at will on or before March&nbsp;31, 2016, (ii)&nbsp;following the shut-down or non-production of the Novasep Facility for a specified period of time, or (iii)&nbsp;upon Novasep&#146;s debarment. Additionally, each party may terminate the
Manufacturing Agreement upon uncured material breach thereof by the other party, upon the other party&#146;s insolvency or bankruptcy, or in the event of a continuing force majeure preventing performance. Upon any termination of the Manufacturing
Agreement by Celladon following the expiration of the post CUPID 2 data termination right either for convenience or for any reason other than material breach of the Manufacturing Agreement, shut-down or non-production of the Novasep Facility for a
period extending longer than six months, or Novasep&#146;s insolvency, the Company is obligated to pay previously-unreimbursed amounts incurred by Novasep and specified termination fees as set forth in the Manufacturing Agreement. </P>
