biotechnology company applying our leadership position in the field of calcium dysregulation by targeting SERCA enzymes to develop novel therapies for diseases with tremendous unmet medical needs. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca <SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2+</SUP> -ATPase, or SERCA, enzymes are a family of enzymes that play an integral part in the regulation of intra-cellular calcium in all human cells. Calcium dysregulation is implicated in a number of
important and complex medical conditions and diseases, such as heart failure, which is a clinical syndrome characterized by poor heart function, resulting in inadequate blood flow to meet the body&#146;s metabolic&nbsp;needs, as well as blood vessel
health, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Our therapeutic portfolio for diseases characterized by SERCA enzyme deficiency includes both gene therapies and small molecule compounds. MYDICAR, our most advanced product candidate, uses gene
therapy to target SERCA2a, which is an enzyme that becomes deficient in patients with heart failure. SERCA2a was scientifically validated as a molecular target for heart failure in the 1990s and became a focus of internal discovery efforts for many
large pharmaceutical companies. However, to date, no other company has been successful in targeting SERCA2a using traditional discovery methods. We believe that our gene therapy approach to modulating SERCA2a overcomes the issues encountered by
previous efforts and has the potential to provide transformative disease-modifying effects with long-term benefits in patients with heart failure. In addition, we have identified a number of potential first-in-class compounds addressing novel
targets in diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases with our small molecule platform of SERCA2b modulators. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are the first company to
enter clinical development with a product candidate, MYDICAR, that selectively targets SERCA2a. We refer to our Phase 1 trial and Phase 2a trial of MYDICAR together as our CUPID 1 trial. In Phase 2a of our CUPID 1 trial, 39 patients with systolic
heart failure, which is caused by the inability of the heart to pump blood efficiently due to weakening and enlargement of the ventricles, were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, where MYDICAR was found to be safe and
well-tolerated, reduced heart failure-related hospitalizations, improved patients&#146; symptoms, quality of life and serum biomarkers, and improved key markers of cardiac function predictive of survival, such as end systolic volume. Based on these
results, as well as our previous preclinical studies and clinical trials, we advanced MYDICAR to a 250-patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international Phase 2b trial in patients with systolic heart failure, which we refer to as
CUPID 2. We completed enrollment of CUPID 2 in February 2014 and expect to announce results in April 2015. If successful, these results, along with other studies, will form the basis for regulatory submissions for approval with the United States
Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA. In 2012, we obtained a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, whereby the FDA agreed to use time-to-multiple heart failure-related hospitalizations as the primary endpoint
for a MYDICAR Phase 3 pivotal trial. Our ongoing CUPID 2 trial uses a similar clinical protocol with identical endpoints as agreed to in the SPA. In May 1998, the FDA published &#147;<I>Guidance for Industry&#151;Providing Clinical Evidence of
Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products&#148;</I> outlining the conditions in which a single trial might be sufficient to support a BLA submission. We believe that the FDA may not require us to complete additional trials of MYDICAR for
the treatment of systolic heart failure if the results of our CUPID 2 trial meet the requirements for a single trial set forth in this guidance. In November 2013, the EMA indicated that if MYDICAR demonstrates a substantial and highly significant
treatment effect in the advanced heart failure population, and no untoward effects attributable to MYDICAR are observed, a safety database of approximately 205-230&nbsp;MYDICAR-treated subjects may be sufficient for a safety assessment to allow for
acceptance of an MAA for MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure. We therefore believe that, if the above conditions are met, a Phase&nbsp;3 trial may not be required for marketing approval in Europe. </P>

group of adeno-associated viruses, or AAVs, sharing specific antigens, to deliver the gene for the SERCA2a enzyme. We believe AAV1 serotype vectors are particularly well suited for administration to the heart muscle because AAV vectors are safe and
are less immunogenic than other viral vectors commonly used in gene therapy. Most people are exposed to wild type AAV (serotype 2) during childhood, without experiencing any symptoms, because AAV causes no disease. In addition, local delivery of
AAV1 to the heart requires extremely small quantities to achieve therapeutic effect, which has contributed to the low incidence of side effects in clinical trials to date. We have developed a companion diagnostic to identify the patients who are
AAV1 neutralizing antibody, or NAb, negative and therefore eligible for&nbsp;MYDICAR treatment. We believe approximately 40% of patients in the United States are AAV1 NAb negative. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, the American Heart Association estimated that there are nearly six&nbsp;million patients currently diagnosed with heart failure in
the United States. Despite optimal guideline-directed therapies employing a wide range of pharmacologic, device, and surgical options, many heart failure patients deteriorate over time. The long-term prognosis associated with heart failure is worse
than that associated with the majority of cancers, with a mortality rate of approximately 50% at five years following initial diagnosis. There are one&nbsp;million primary heart failure-related hospitalizations and over 280,000 heart failure-related
deaths annually in the United States. In 2010, the estimated direct and indirect cost of heart failure in the United States was $39 billion, half of which was related to repeated hospitalizations. The one- and six-month readmission rates after heart
failure-related hospitalization are close to 25% and 50%, respectively, and there is growing pressure on hospitals to reduce readmissions for heart failure. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are initially developing MYDICAR to treat patients with systolic heart failure. Heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is
characterized by a decreased contraction of the heart muscle. We also plan to develop MYDICAR for additional indications, such as arteriovenous fistula, or AVF, maturation failure, and for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure who
are on a left-ventricular assist device, or LVAD. Subject to raising additional capital, we also may initiate development programs in diastolic heart failure, which is caused by the inability of the heart to relax normally between contractions, and
pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, which is characterized by a SERCA2a deficiency in vascular smooth muscle cells. MYDICAR has demonstrated potential disease-modifying capability in preclinical models of these diseases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We hold worldwide rights to MYDICAR in all indications and markets. We plan to commercialize MYDICAR for all approved heart failure
indications using a targeted sales force in the United States focused on selected cardiologists and heart failure specialists who treat the majority of heart failure patients. We believe we can maximize the value of our company by retaining
substantial commercialization rights to our product candidates and, where appropriate, entering into partnerships for specific therapeutic indications and/or geographic territories. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also investigating MYDICAR for enhancing the rate of AVF maturation. This program is currently in pre-clinical development. Over
500,000 Americans have end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis and approximately 100,000 fistulae are placed yearly. An AVF, which is a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein, is placed in the arm to provide access for
hemodialysis. The access that is created is routinely used for hemodialysis two to five times per week. The AVF has proven to be the most durable, least complicated, and therefore preferred mode of vascular access for hemodialysis. The clinical
problem that has resulted from this practice is that following surgery to create the fistula, approximately 50% of fistulae fail to mature to a usable state for hemodialysis. Furthermore, as many as 25% of hospital admissions in the dialysis
population have been attributed to vascular access problems, including fistula malfunction and thrombosis. The biology of SERCA2a in both vascular smooth muscle cells, or VSMC, and endothelial cells provides a unique opportunity to potentially
positively impact the pathological processes driving fistula failure. The majority of AVF maturation failures have been attributed to rapid proliferation of VSMC, resulting in vascular blockage or occlusion. In preclinical studies, SERCA2a enzyme
deficiency has been associated with VSMC proliferation, and increasing SERCA2a activity has been shown to prevent VSMC proliferation and stenosis of injured blood </P>

intricate workings of the heart, calcium is considered perhaps the most important. It enables the chambers of the heart to pump, or contract and relax, which causes blood to be propelled in and out of the heart. Calcium directly activates the
myofilaments, which are threadlike structures in muscle fibers which cause contraction. Dysregulation of calcium is a central cause of heart failure due to both contractile (systolic) dysfunction, and relaxation (diastolic) dysfunction. One of the
central causes of calcium dysregulation in heart failure is a deficiency in the level of SERCA2a enzymes in heart muscle cells. SERCA2a deficiencies are not limited to heart muscle cells, but are also present in blood vessel disorders such as AVF
maturation failure and PAH. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another focus of our research program relates to a different form of the SERCA2 enzyme, SERCA2b.
Specifically, these enzymes control calcium movement in the ER in all human cells. SERCA2b enzyme levels become deficient when cells are stressed, and accumulate unfolded proteins in the ER, known as ER stress. There has been a proliferation of
publications in scientific medical literature supporting the important role of ER stress in many diseases and conditions, including heart failure, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. We believe we are the industry leader in isolating small
molecule modulators of the SERCA2b enzyme, which can correct underlying calcium dysregulation and ER stress. Our proprietary, novel, first-in-class, compounds have demonstrated activity in multiple preclinical models of diseases and conditions. </P>

blood from the heart is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body. In 2013, the American Heart Association estimated that there are nearly six&nbsp;million patients currently diagnosed with heart failure in the United States. The
prevalence of heart failure is progressively increasing due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of major cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity and diabetes. Additional risk factors for heart failure include coronary heart
disease, hypertension, alcoholism, drug abuse, exposure to toxins and infectious agents, pregnancy and congenital mutations. It is estimated that one in five adults at age&nbsp;40 will develop heart failure during their remaining lifetime, and that
approximately 250,000 to 500,000 patients in the United States are currently in the terminal phase of heart failure and have symptoms that cannot be effectively managed by existing optimized medical therapy. These patients suffer from disabling
symptoms and often need hospitalization. The long-term prognosis associated with heart failure is worse than that associated with the majority of cancers, with approximate 50% mortality at five years following initial diagnosis. With over 280,000
heart failure-related deaths annually, we believe MYDICAR will provide a much needed therapeutic alternative for heart failure patients. We estimate that there are over 350,000 systolic heart failure patients in the United States alone who will be

readmission rates after heart failure-related hospitalization are close to 25% and 50%, respectively. The Affordable Care Act recently established the &#147;Hospital Readmissions Reduction
Program,&#148; which requires Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services to reduce payments to hospitals with excessive heart failure readmissions. As such, there is a growing pressure on hospitals to reduce readmissions for heart failure.

respond to increased metabolic demand, such as during intense physical activity. Patients suffer from increased shortness of breath in a progressive manner, and mild exercise soon exceeds the capacity of the heart to react to the increase in
metabolic demand. Towards the end stage of the disease, the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet what the body needs even at rest. At this stage, fluids accumulate in the extremities or in the lungs, making the patient bedridden and unable to
perform activities of daily living. In addition to constant shortness of breath, even minor deviation from a physical activity and diet restricted lifestyle can cause acute exacerbations, during which patients experience a drowning sensation and
must be urgently hospitalized in intensive care or cardiac care units. Heart failure is classified in relation to the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient. The most commonly used classification system, established by the New York

classes of heart failure is a function of the severity of the disease with the more advanced patients having poorer survival prognosis. Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure emphasizes angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE,
inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers if the patient is ACE intolerant, and beta blockers. There is recommendation for cardiac resynchronization therapy in certain patients. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, or ICDs, are used in
patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. Despite these optimal guideline-directed therapies employing a wide range of pharmacologic, device, and surgical options, many patients deteriorate over time and develop advanced heart failure symptoms that
cannot be effectively managed by existing optimized medical therapy. At the end stage of heart failure disease, current treatment options include heart transplant surgery or implantation of an LVAD. LVADs are battery operated mechanical circulatory
devices used to partially or completely replace the function of the left ventricle of the heart for patients awaiting a heart transplant, or as a destination therapy for patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure who will never receive a heart
transplant. Both of these end-stage treatment options require invasive open-chest surgery, include a host of complications such as lifetime immunosuppressive therapy in the case of transplant and risk of thrombosis and infection in the case of
LVADs, and can cost in excess of $150,000. An estimated 1,500 patients per year in the United States have an LVAD implanted and an estimated 2,300 patients per year in the United States undergo heart transplant surgery. </P>

process. Intracellular calcium movements in the heart are tightly regulated at various levels within the heart&#146;s cells. An organelle called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, or SR, plays an important role in orchestrating the movement of calcium
during each contraction and relaxation. The cardiac cycle is illustrated in the figure below. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt" ALIGN="center">

contraction. During relaxation, the majority of calcium is sequestered back into the SR by the SERCA2a enzyme leading to muscle relaxation. It is modulated through normal physiology via a protein known as phospholamban (PLB in the figure above),
increasing activity when we exercise and decreasing activity when we rest. In advanced heart failure, SERCA2a enzyme levels are abnormally low, so patients cannot effectively modulate SERCA2a activity and increase their cardiac output even upon mild
physical activity, such as walking or climbing stairs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The figure below depicts <I>in vitro</I> studies of the contraction and relaxation

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Heart failure can be caused by a problem with cardiac contraction, relaxation, or both. Ejection
fraction, or EF, is the measurement used to describe the contractility of the heart. Approximately half of heart failure patients suffer from contractility abnormalities (systolic heart failure, EF less than 35%) and the other half suffer from
relaxation abnormalities (diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with preserved EF). Both forms represent a significant unmet medical need and we are also developing MYDICAR to target the diastolic form of the disease. Diastolic heart failure is
characterized by a &#147;stiff&#148; ventricle, which impairs relaxation of the heart between contractions. We believe MYDICAR can effectively treat diastolic heart failure by correcting the SERCA2a deficiency and improving the ability of the heart
to relax between contractions. Based on the Framingham Heart Study conducted by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and Boston University, the five-year mortality rate for patients with diastolic heart failure is 45&#150;60%, which
demonstrates the significant unmet need for effective treatments for this condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>MYDICAR: Genetic Enzyme Replacement Therapy of
SERCA2a Deficiency </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our lead product candidate, MYDICAR, uses genetic enzyme replacement therapy to correct the SERCA2a enzyme
deficiency in heart failure patients that results in inadequate pumping of the heart. MYDICAR is delivered directly to the heart in a routine outpatient procedure, similar to an angiogram, in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. MYDICAR has the
potential to provide transformative disease-modifying effects with long-term benefits in heart failure patients with a single administration. We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, in December 2006 for MYDICAR for the treatment of
heart failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gene therapy alters a person&#146;s deficient genetic material (encoded by deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA). The altered
genes, in turn, through a process called gene expression, can then produce the correct proteins and/or enzymes that were otherwise being produced improperly, or in the case of SERCA2 deficiency, at abnormally low levels. Gene therapy is accomplished
through a process known as gene transfer, whereby a functional gene is delivered and incorporated into a patient&#146;s cells through a delivery system called a vector, which are most commonly based on naturally-occurring viruses that have been
modified to take advantage of the virus&#146; natural ability to introduce genes into cells. However, unlike naturally-occurring viruses, which replicate following infection of a target cell and have the capacity to infect new cells, viral vectors
are modified to be non-replicating by deleting that portion of the viral genome responsible for replication. We believe that the growing body of gene therapy-based clinical data and the establishment of regulatory guidelines to govern the
development and approval of gene therapy products suggest that gene therapy is positioned to emerge as an important new therapeutic modality for patients with significant unmet medical need. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MYDICAR, or AAV1/SERCA2a, utilizes AAV1 to deliver the gene for the enzyme SERCA2a. AAV1/SERCA2a consists of an outer protein shell, called a
capsid, and inner DNA genome that contains a gene for SERCA2a. In a treated patient, the capsid delivers the genome to the target cell, where the DNA will direct expression of the SERCA2a protein. Different strains of AAV, called serotypes, have
slightly different capsids, which target the vector to different cell types. AAV vectors are particularly well suited for the treatment of heart failure because: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

high-dose group a significant reduction. In the low- and mid-dose groups, we believe the dose was not sufficient to insert the SERCA2a gene in enough cells of the myocardium to generate a long-lasting improvement in contractility. We have confirmed
this in biopsy samples (see &#147;CUPID 1 (CELL-001) Long-term Follow-up&#148; below), since MYDICAR vector DNA was only detected at long time points in cardiac biopsies in the high-dose patients, but not in biopsies from any other group. MYDICAR
increases the presence of an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells and this enables blood vessels to relax, thereby resulting in short-term increased blood flow. Our hypothesis for why the low- and mid-dose groups demonstrate a
delay of the onset of clinical events which is not durable relates to the short-term increase in blood flow to the heart after MYDICAR therapy; higher doses are required to insert the gene deep into the cardiac muscle cells. </P>

failure population, and no untoward effects attributable to MYDICAR are observed, a safety database of approximately 205-230 MYDICAR-treated subjects may be sufficient for a safety assessment to allow for acceptance of an MAA for MYDICAR for the
treatment of systolic heart failure. We therefore believe that, if the above conditions are met, a Phase&nbsp;3 trial may not be required for marketing approval in Europe. We have also held a Type A SPA meeting with the FDA, as a result of which the
FDA approved a 572-patient Phase 3 trial protocol under the SPA guidance and agreed that the design and planned analyses of this trial would be sufficient to provide data that, depending on outcome, could support a license application submission.
Pursuant to the SPA, we also obtained an agreement from the FDA that the primary efficacy endpoint of time-to-recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence of terminal events would be acceptable for a pivotal trial of MYDICAR.
This endpoint counts multiple heart failure-related hospitalizations per patient, and &#147;corrects&#148; for the occurrence of terminal events. Other elements of the Phase 3 SPA protocol may be changed if agreed to in writing by both the FDA and
us, including sample size. We are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding the use of the joint frailty statistical model as a method of analysis for the primary endpoint. Our extensive simulation studies have demonstrated that when recurrent
heart failure-related hospitalizations and terminal events are correlated, the joint frailty model provides both high power to detect a treatment effect and strong control of false-positive rate. The FDA is currently performing additional
simulations using our proprietary software to validate that the false-positive rate is acceptable for a pivotal trial using the joint frailty model. </P>

failure-related hospitalizations for MYDICAR versus placebo adjusted for correlated terminal events), will be calculated using the joint frailty model. The secondary endpoint is time-to-first terminal event (all-cause death, heart transplant or LVAD
implantation). Additional endpoints include Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (quality of life) and six-minute walk test (exercise capacity). NYHA class will be descriptively summarized by time point for each treatment group. </P>

heart failure-related hospitalizations, should provide at least 83% power at the 0.05 two-sided significance level to detect at least a 45% risk reduction (hazard ratio of 0.55) based on time-to-recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations in
the presence of the terminal events. The assumed magnitude of treatment effect is based on the data from published studies in heart failure patients and a conservative estimate of the anticipated magnitude of effect of MYDICAR based on 12-month
results from CUPID&nbsp;1 that showed an 88% reduction in recurrent clinical events adjusted for correlated terminal events with high-dose MYDICAR compared to placebo. We completed enrollment of this trial in February 2014 and expect to announce
results in April 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon completion of our CUPID 2 trial, the results will be discussed with the FDA and the EMA with the possibility
that MYDICAR could potentially qualify for approval if the trial outcome demonstrates substantial reduction in recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations and concordant trends in reduction in and/or delay of terminal events overall, and death
in particular. However, if the FDA requires a further trial, we have an SPA in place for an approximately 572-patient Phase 3 pivotal trial using the same endpoint as in our CUPID 2 trial. We believe the results of one or both of these trials could
support submission of a BLA for MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure. In November 2013, the EMA indicated that if MYDICAR demonstrates a substantial and highly significant treatment effect in the advanced heart failure population, and

enhanced expression of SERCA2 have also been demonstrated in an ovine (sheep) pacing-induced heart failure model with MYDICAR. SERCA2 gene transfer has also been associated with restoration of SERCA2a expression and improved heart function in both a
dog-pacing heart failure model and in a chronic myocardial ischemia-induced heart failure model in mini-pigs. Beyond the effects on enhancing contractility, SERCA2a gene transfer has been shown in preclinical studies to restore the energetic state
of the heart (both in terms of energy supply and utilization), to decrease arrhythmias, and enhance blood flow to the heart through expression in endothelial cells. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Several studies we have sponsored have established pharmacologic activity for MYDICAR gene transfer in animals with heart failure, with data
demonstrating restored SERCA2a expression and stabilization/improvement in heart function. The pharmacology study was conducted in the porcine (pig) mitral regurgitation, or MR, heart failure model. MR induces reduced myocardial contractility,
elevated B-type natriuretic peptide, or BNP, levels and other signs and markers which are virtually identical to those associated with the human disease, including a decrease in SERCA2a expression. MYDICAR-treated animals demonstrated significant
improvements in the heart&#146;s ability to contract and relax and improved ventricular volumes. In these studies, there was an absolute increase of 16% in median EF in MYDICAR-treated animals as compared to control animals. ESV increased in the
control group by a median of 16&nbsp;milliliters, or a median relative increase of 35%, an indication of decreased contractility and cardiac enlargement, compared with the MYDICAR group, which showed a tendency to decrease LV ESV by a median of
9.9&nbsp;milliliters (a median decrease of 14%). In humans, a reduction in ESV of 10% signifies clinically relevant reverse remodeling, which is a strong predictor of lower long-term mortality and heart failure clinical events. Treated animals also
had lower BNP levels post-dosing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have also sponsored two safety toxicology and biodistribution studies, both in normal mini-pigs.
Both were three-month studies simulating the clinical administration procedure for MYDICAR or placebo with 5, 30 and 90&nbsp;day sacrifice time points. Doses of up to three times the human dose on a weight-adjusted basis were administered. No
mortalities were observed in either study and treatment with MYDICAR was not associated with any signs of toxicity or effects on body weight, sperm motility, clinical pathology, gross pathology, clinical chemistry parameters, organ weights or
histopathology. No significant effects were observed on cardiovascular parameters, including electrocardiographic intervals. There were no test article-related observations during the necropsies. Mild increases in troponin I were observed in
eight&nbsp;out of a total of 36&nbsp;MYDICAR-treated animals in the first study, barely above upper limits of normal for humans. These increases were not considered to be related to MYDICAR or biologically significant and were not observed in the
second study. No treatment related changes in troponin I values were observed across the other large animal pharmacology studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>MYDICAR in

arteriovenous fistula, or AVF, which is a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein in the arm of the patient, has proven to be the most durable, least complicated, and therefore preferred mode of vascular access for hemodialysis.
The access that is created is routinely used for hemodialysis two to five times per week. Approximately 100,000 fistulae are placed yearly in the United States. However, a clinical problem that has resulted from this practice is that, following
surgery to create the fistula, approximately 50% of the fistulae fail to mature to a usable state, and as many as 25% of hospital admissions in the dialysis population have been attributed to vascular access problems, including fistula malfunction
and thrombosis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Role of SERCA2a in Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation Failure </I></B></P>

hemodialysis. The role of SERCA2a in normal and diseased blood vessel biology has been extensively studied. Maturation failure of an AVF has been attributed to rapid proliferation of VSMC resulting in vascular occlusion. The histological lesion that
appears to be associated with early AVF failure is referred to as neointimal hyperplasia, comprising VSMC, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells within microvessels. In the setting of early AVF failure, both aggressive neointimal hyperplasia and
adverse vascular remodeling (vasoconstriction or an inability to dilate adequately) plays a role. In particular, the combination of early and aggressive neointimal hyperplasia together with adverse vascular remodeling results in aggressive early
stenosis. The biology of SERCA2a in both VSMC and endothelial cells provides a unique opportunity to potentially positively impact these pathological processes: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Transfer in Patients with Heart Failure and an LVAD </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This trial is partially funded by the British Heart Foundation, sponsored by
Imperial College London, and is expected to start in the first half of 2014. We are providing investigational medicinal product and some financial support. It is not a required trial by any regulatory authorities; however, it could potentially serve
as a proof-of-concept trial to support the use of MYDICAR to wean patients off of an LVAD. The use of these devices present a host of risk factors for the patient, such as increased risk of thrombosis and infections, and these devices do not last
for long periods of time. Given that the circulatory system of a patient with an LVAD is dependent on these devices, device failure usually translates to a catastrophic event for the patient. The primary objectives of the SERCA2a-LVAD trial are to
determine (1)&nbsp;the safety and feasibility of using MYDICAR to treat heart failure patients who have an LVAD, (2)&nbsp;how well MYDICAR delivers the gene for SERCA2a to heart cells and (3)&nbsp;what impact circulating NAbs to AAV1 have on the
ability of MYDICAR to deliver the SERCA2a gene to heart muscle cells. This trial is expected to enroll approximately 24 patients in the United Kingdom with varying levels of circulating NAbs to AAV1, 16 of whom will be treated with MYDICAR and eight
with placebo. Six months post-treatment, all patients will undergo a heart biopsy for collection of tissue to determine the presence of the SERCA2a gene. In addition, safety data and changes in LV function will be collected and analyzed. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As in systolic heart failure, a consistent finding in diastolic heart failure is a decrease in the expression of SERCA2a&#151;a change that is
seen in most animal models of heart failure and in human hearts with diastolic dysfunction. In preclinical studies, overexpressing SERCA2a using gene therapy in streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice demonstrated that increasing SERCA2a could
improve diastolic function. In human cardiomyocytes isolated from the left ventricle of patients with end-stage heart failure, SERCA2a levels were correlated with improved diastolic function. We have also evaluated MYDICAR in another preclinical
study in a rat model for spontaneous non-insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by diastolic dysfunction and associated with abnormal calcium levels and decrease in SERCA2a expression. In this study, SERCA2a gene
transfer restored diastolic function to normal. These data showed that SERCA2a overexpression may be used as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this disease. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SERCA2a gene transfer has also been demonstrated to improve diastolic cardiac function in aged animals. In preclinical studies, cardiac
SERCA2a protein and ATPase activity were significantly decreased in elderly rat hearts compared with adult rats and were restored to adult levels after SERCA2a gene transfer. Diastolic function parameters, which were adversely affected in elderly
rat hearts, were restored by overexpression of SERCA2a, supporting the hypothesis that decreased SERCA2a contributes to the functional abnormalities observed in elderly hearts and demonstrating that targeting SERCA2a in the elderly heart may lead to
improved diastolic cardiac function. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The MYDICAR- HF/pEF trial would be our pilot clinical trial for the treatment of diastolic heart
failure, which comprises approximately half of all heart failure cases. Subject to raising additional capital, we anticipate that the existing data we have generated for our proposed systolic heart failure indication would allow us to launch
directly into a Phase&nbsp;1/2 trial in approximately 40 patients with diastolic heart failure with the objectives of assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of a single intracoronary infusion of high-dose MYDICAR compared to placebo. Patients
would be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 (MYDICAR versus placebo) and safety would be assessed in a manner similar to the assessment method used in our CUPID 2 trial. Preliminary efficacy would be assessed by concordant clinically meaningful changes at
six months versus baseline in diastolic function, NT-proBNP, NYHA, quality of life, distance walked in the six-minute walk test and recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence of terminal events. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PAH is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or pulmonary capillaries, together known as the lung vasculature,
leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, leg swelling and other symptoms. PAH can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and&nbsp;an increased likelihood of heart failure. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PAH is characterized by dysregulated proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, or PASMC, leading to maladaptive vascular
remodeling. In the systemic circulation, vascular injury is associated with downregulation of SERCA2a, and subsequent alterations in calcium homeostasis in PASMC stimulates proliferation of PASMC. SERCA2a expression is decreased significantly in
remodeled pulmonary arteries from patients with PAH and the rat monocrotaline, or MCT, model of PAH. In preclinical studies, overexpression of SERCA2a in human coronary artery endothelial cells <I>in vitro </I>resulted in increased endothelial
nitric oxide synthase expression and activation, which increased vascular relaxation. In MCT rats with established PAH, gene transfer of SERCA2a via intratracheal delivery of MYDICAR decreased pulmonary artery pressure, vascular remodeling, right
ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis compared to controls. Similarly, aerosolized MYDICAR delivered at the time of MCT administration limited adverse hemodynamic profiles and indices of pulmonary and cardiac remodeling compared with controls. </P>

well-established referral networks with supporting interventional cardiologists and cardiac catheterization laboratories. We believe they represent a concentrated customer base suitable to a specialist care sales model. We believe that MYDICAR would
be adopted first by high-volume key-opinion-leader hospitals and medical centers, and progressively by a broader segment of the market. We believe that therapy adoption generally occurs much faster in the United States compared to Europe or the rest
of the world. Cardiologists, heart failure specialists, and interventional cardiologists, have a history of early adoption of innovative products and technologies, in part because the rate of innovation in this sector has been sustained, and in part
because of the large unmet need that their patients exhibit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We therefore believe that a commercial strategy involving a progressive

and the production system. AAV vectors are made &#147;gutless,&#148; meaning that they do not contain viral genes. Only the two small non-coding elements from the parent virus are needed for replicating and packaging the vector DNA during
production, which can be provided separately. The genome was also designed to be very close to the size of the parent AAV genome, to optimally fit within the AAV capsid. </P>

the manufacturers of recombinant monoclonal antibodies or proteins, we use cell-suspension based culturing techniques and intend to use stirred tank bioreactors for large scale cell culture and production. Our envisioned commercial production scale
is 2,000 liters, which is one-tenth the volume of the largest industrial production vessels, so our anticipated production scale is far from the limits of the technology. We selected stirred tank production bioreactor technology as our production
system because it has been the workhorse for recombinant protein production for more than 20 years. For purification of AAV1/SERCA2a, we use industrial chromatography columns and resins, and filtration technology common to the biopharmaceutical
industry. We believe these materials and equipment are common for good manufacturing practices, or GMP, manufacturing of FDA approved biological products. </P>

standard cell culture techniques and standard equipment in production and purification found in industrial cell culture drug manufacturing. All media used for cell growth and production are free of animal-derived components. To induce production of
AAV1/SERCA2a, the cells are infected with a highly characterized batch of adenovirus. AAV viruses in nature and AAV vectors are not capable of replicating on their own and require a helper virus, such as adenovirus, to initiate replication. The
purification process was designed to yield a high purity AAV1/SERCA2a product. Special attention was placed on the inactivation and removal of adenovirus and its free components, clearance of DNA and protein impurities, and even intact host cells.

produced at 250 liters, two batches were successfully produced under GMP manufacturing conditions at Targeted Genetics Corporation (now AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation) in Seattle, Washington. We expect risk for scale-up to the 2,000-liter
commercial scale to be minimal, based on our knowledge and experience, and the proven track record of the stirred tank bioreactor technology and industrial chromatography. We have selected a contract manufacturing organization, Lonza, a worldwide
leader of biological product manufacturing with extensive experience in viral manufacturing, for transfer of the process and conducting the scale-up to the commercial scale of 2,000 liters, which is expected in 2014. Our experienced technical staff

pharmaceutical industries in which we operate are subject to rapid change and are characterized by intense competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger
and better-funded pharmaceutical companies. While we believe that MYDICAR&#146;s unique mechanism of action provides us with competitive advantages, particularly given that MYDICAR is designed to be administered in conjunction with other
pharmacological agents and devices (except LVADs), we have identified several companies which are active in the advancement of gene therapy products in the heart failure arena as of the date of this report. Not only must we compete with other
companies that are focused on gene therapy treatments, any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we expect to potentially compete with include Renova Therapeutics, NanoCor
Therapeutics, Juventas Therapeutics, VentriNova and Beat BioTherapeutics. Renova, Beat BioTherapeutics and Juventas are in the clinical stages of development with their gene therapy products targeting moderate to advanced heart failure. Renova is
using adenovirus serotype 5 encoding human adenylyl cyclase type 6 in a Phase 1/2 trial, while Juventas is enrolling a Phase 2 trial with its product candidate JVS100, which is a non-viral plasmid that encodes for stromal cell-derived factor-1
(SDF-1). NanoCor (BNP delivery of I1), VentriNova (cyclin A2), and Beat BioTherapeutics (AAV/R1R2) are in the preclinical testing of their gene therapy product candidates for the treatment of heart failure. These companies also compete with us in
recruiting human capital and securing licenses to complementary technologies that may be critical to the success of our business. They also compete with us for potential funding from the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Our potential
competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. In addition, as the presence of pre-existing NAbs against the proteins that encapsulate the AAV1 gene therapy agent can block entry of the AAV1 gene
therapy agents into their target cells, previous patient exposure to other AAV1-based gene therapies, irrespective of the condition or disease they aim to treat, would render a patient ineligible for MYDICAR therapy and could therefore be considered
competitive to MYDICAR. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of MYDICAR
and any other product candidates that we develop are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, value, price and the availability of reimbursement from the government and other third-parties. Our commercial
opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors have products which are better in one or more of these categories. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biological product may also be eligible for PTE. PTE
permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted
commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the
submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE for only one patent applicable to an approved drug, and the maximum period of restoration is five years beyond the expiration of the patent. A PTE
cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and a patent can only be extended once, and thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on
one product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in
the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for PTEs for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For additional

products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&amp;C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and
regulations. Both the FD&amp;C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting,
advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of a biological product begins, and each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA and,
in some instances, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and
the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. To date,
the FDA has never approved a gene therapy product for commercial sale. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health Center, or CDRH,
regulates companion diagnostics, and the Office of Combination Products regulates combination products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CBER works closely with the NIH
and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have
published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment,
observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting
or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or
pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether
legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. </P>

candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and

submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the trial is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA
Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the
NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee, which discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its
quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.

of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any
time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure
that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of
qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject
selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol
must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#146;s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed
consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare
and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of
the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a
local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. </P>

days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#146;s initial
receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any
time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated gene therapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate
approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic
interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or
that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on
gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the
physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use
of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product
candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability
studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>U.S.
Review and Approval Processes </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained
before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other
relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing
and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA,
as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biological products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to
manufacture prescription biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on
BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Within 60 days following
submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time

subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine,
among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the
product&#146;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a
panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it
considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the
biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless
it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will
typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time,
money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the submission of relevant
data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we
interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified
may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in
a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for
use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and
conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4

Designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Programs </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended
to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or
life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a
new drug or biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biological product as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review
sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and
determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough
Therapy designation, also exist. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or
prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing
treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict
a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval
perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial
launch of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A product may also be eligible for receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation. The Breakthrough Therapy
designation is intended to expedite the FDA&#146;s review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases where &#147;preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing
therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.&#148; The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy provides the same benefits as are available under the
Fast Track program, as well as intensive FDA guidance on the product&#146;s development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may
expedite the development or approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Combination Products </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Combination products include products where two or more separate products are packaged together (e.g., drug and device products); or a product packaged
separately but intended for use only with an approved, individually specified product, where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product, the labeling of the individually
specified product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Regulation of Companion Diagnostics </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the FD&amp;C Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among
other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import,
and post-market surveillance. Companion diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FD&amp;C Act. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and PMA approval. We anticipate that the companion diagnostic tests we are developing will be subject to
the PMA approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data,
including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and
clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers
to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require
several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that
must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will
outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for
several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other
regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We and our third-party collaborators who
may develop our companion diagnostics will work cooperatively to generate the data required for submission with the PMA application, and will remain in close contact with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, at the FDA to ensure
that any changes in requirements are incorporated into the development plans. We anticipate that, as was the case in our meetings to date, future meetings with the FDA with regard to MYDICAR and its companion diagnostic product candidate will
include representatives from both the CBER and the CDRH to ensure that the BLA and PMA submissions are coordinated to enable the FDA to conduct a parallel review of both submissions. On July&nbsp;14, 2011, the FDA issued for comment a draft guidance
document addressing the development and approval process for &#147;In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.&#148; According to the draft guidance, for novel products such as MYDICAR, the PMA for a companion diagnostic device should be developed and
approved contemporaneously with the biological product. While this draft guidance is not yet finalized, we believe our programs for the development of our companion diagnostics are consistent with the draft guidance as proposed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Post-approval Requirements </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Maintaining
substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval,
particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply
with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations

may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information,
and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each
lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history
of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#146;s tests performed on the lot. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of
biological products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also must comply with the FDA&#146;s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to
direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#146;s approved labeling (known as &#147;off-label use&#148;), industry-sponsored scientific and
educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or
withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an
applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters,
product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement
of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required
to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to
expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including
withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications
and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Coverage and Reimbursement </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government
healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign
governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption
of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover
our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. </P>

For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market
exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic
marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the
European Union&#146;s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ten-year

December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $112.6 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders&#146; equity and working capital.

expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings or strategic collaborations. We have not completed pivotal clinical trials for any product candidate and it will be several years, if ever, before we have a product
candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate (and, if necessary, any related companion diagnostic), our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our product
candidates have received approval, and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our product candidates and companion diagnostic in those markets. </P>

failure and our small molecule product candidates are in preclinical development for the treatment of diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, our ability to generate product revenues and to achieve commercial success in the near term will initially
depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure in the United&nbsp;States and the European Economic Area, or EEA.
Before we can market and sell MYDICAR in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, we will need to commence and complete additional clinical trials, manage clinical and manufacturing activities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA

obtain regulatory approvals and sufficient commercial manufacturing supply for MYDICAR or its companion diagnostic. To date, no gene therapy product has ever been approved in the United States. If we do not receive regulatory approvals, our
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. Even if we obtain regulatory approvals, we may never generate significant revenues from any commercial sales of MYDICAR. If we fail to successfully

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have primarily concentrated our research and development efforts on our lead product candidate, MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart
failure, and our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of this product candidate. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our product candidates will not cause
significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. In addition, our product development program is dependent on the development and commercialization of a required companion diagnostic by us or by third party
collaborators. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and those diagnostic tools must independently be cleared or approved by the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities before we may commercialize our
product candidates. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or
commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA
and other foreign regulatory authorities, and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential
products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. For example, the FDA has
required us to conduct a safety and efficacy trial of patients with pre-existing NAbs to the AAV-based vectors used by MYDICAR as well as a viral shedding trial to determine the dissemination of our MYDICAR vector particles into the environment. At
the moment, no gene therapy product has been approved in the United States and only one gene therapy product, UniQure&#146;s Glybera, which received marketing authorization from the EMA in 2012, has been approved in Europe but has not yet been
launched for commercial sale, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either the United States or Europe. Approvals by the EMA may not be
indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and
may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related
products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of
Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146; Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process
can impede the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an investigational new drug application, or IND, on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable
review. For example, our IND for MYDICAR, which we filed with the FDA in December 2006, was placed on clinical </P>

an NIH-funded institution, that institution&#146;s institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in
clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities to change the requirements for approval of any of our gene therapy-based product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These regulatory review committees and advisory groups, and the new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process,
require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval
limitations or restrictions. As we advance the development of our gene therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be
required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approvals necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate
sufficient product revenue to maintain our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Failure to successfully validate, commercialize and obtain regulatory approval for our

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A key element of our strategy is to screen out patients with certain amounts of pre-existing NAbs to the AAV1 viral vector used by MYDICAR. We
have developed a companion diagnostic that will be used in combination with MYDICAR to help us better identify those patients that may benefit from treatment with MYDICAR. Accordingly, we will be dependent on such companion diagnostic, both during
our clinical trials and in connection with any future commercialization of MYDICAR for systolic heart failure or for other indications. We expect that we will enter into a strategic alliance with a third party for the automation and
commercialization of our companion diagnostic. We and any of our future collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing the companion diagnostic for commercial application, including issues in relation to automation, selectivity/specificity,
analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of such companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate
regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization. In the case of MYDICAR, we anticipate that the FDA will require approval of the companion diagnostic under a medical device pre-market approval, or PMA, application prior to approval and
commercialization of MYDICAR, which could delay our ability to commercialize both products. If we or any of our future collaborators fail to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic or are delayed in receiving such approval, our
ability to commercialize MYDICAR would be delayed until such time as regulatory approval is obtained. In addition, our future collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostic, and both
they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostic in the clinical community. MYDICAR and certain of the off-the-shelf administration components used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory are regulated as
combination products. These include products where two or more separate products are packaged together (e.g., drug and device products); or a product packaged separately but intended for use only with an approved, individually specified product
where both are required to achieve the intended use of the proposed product. MYDICAR will include labelling that specifies certain administration products, and the labeling of some of the administration products may need to be changed, e.g., to
reflect a change in intended use, which revisions could delay our ability to commercialize MYDICAR. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may find it difficult to enroll patients in

60% of potential patients in the United States exhibiting these antibodies. In other countries, such as Poland, the prevalence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs is significantly higher. These antibodies neutralize the effectiveness of AAV-based vectors,
such as MYDICAR, and although we are able to prescreen for the presence of these antibodies, the high prevalence of these antibodies in humans reduces the pool of available trial participants. In addition, because therapy with AAV vectors can cause
the body to produce NAbs after as little as one treatment, the pool of available trial participants may also be reduced if AAV vectors are increasingly used to treat heart failure or other conditions. </P>

provide sufficient support for a BLA submission. Although our CUPID 1 trial met its primary safety and efficacy endpoints at six months for high-dose MYDICAR versus placebo and the safety profile
from this trial was very favorable, it is still possible that, even if we achieve favorable results in the CUPID 2 trial, the FDA may require us to conduct one or more additional clinical trials, possibly involving a larger sample size or a
different clinical trial design, particularly if the FDA does not find the results from the CUPID 2 trial to be sufficiently persuasive to support a BLA submission. For example, the FDA advised us in October 2013 that the number of subjects in our
proposed safety database may be an issue to be considered in review of our BLA submission. The FDA may also require that we conduct a longer follow-up period of subjects treated with our MYDICAR product candidate prior to accepting our BLA
submission. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 1998, the FDA published &#147; <I>Guidance for Industry&#151;Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human
Drug and Biological Products&#148;</I> outlining the conditions in which a single trial might be sufficient to support a BLA submission. We believe that the FDA may not require us to complete additional trials of MYDICAR for the treatment of
systolic heart failure if the results of our CUPID 2 trial meet the requirements for a single trial set forth in this guidance. In addition, in November 2013, the EMA indicated that if MYDICAR demonstrates a substantial and highly significant
treatment effect in the advanced heart failure population, and no untoward effects attributable to MYDICAR are observed, a safety database of approximately 205-230 MYDICAR- treated subjects may be sufficient for a safety assessment to allow for
acceptance of a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure. We therefore believe that, if the above conditions are met, a Phase 3 trial will not be required for marketing approval in Europe.
It is possible, however, that the FDA or the EMA may not consider the results of our CUPID 2 trial to be sufficient for approval of MYDICAR for the treatment of systolic heart failure. If the FDA or the EMA requires additional studies, including
Phase 3 trials, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which would require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and the EMA may have divergent opinions on
the elements necessary for a successful BLA and MAA, respectively, which may cause us to alter our development, regulatory and/or commercialization strategies. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with MYDICAR may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or
events. Although extensive preclinical safety and biodistribution testing conducted on MYDICAR and other AAV vectors, including the CUPID 1 trial of MYDICAR for systolic heart failure and data from previous clinical trials of other AAV vectors,
suggests that MYDICAR will be well tolerated, known adverse side effects that could present with treatment with AAV vectors include an immunologic reaction to the capsid protein or gene at early timepoints after administration. In previous clinical
trials involving AAV viral vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced serious adverse events, including the development of T-cell response due to immune response against the vector capsid proteins. If our vectors demonstrate a similar
effect, or other adverse events, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, theoretical adverse side effects of AAV vectors include replication and spread of the virus to other parts of
the body and insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the insertion of a corrected gene near a gene that is important in cell growth or division results in uncontrolled cell division, also known as cancer, which could potentially
enhance the risk of malignant transformation. Potential procedure-related events are similar to those associated with standard coronary intervention procedures, and may include vascular injury (e.g., damage to the femoral, radial, or brachial
arteries at the site of vascular access, or damage to the coronary arteries) or myocardial injury. If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities
could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the
trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. </P>

be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon
additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a
treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable
for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will

impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the holder of an approved BLA is
obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA. The holder of an approved BLA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the
approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review,&nbsp;in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. </P>

perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gene therapy remains a novel technology, with no gene therapy product approved to date in the United&nbsp;States and only one gene therapy
product approved to date in Europe. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon
physicians specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments they are already familiar with and
for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion could have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of
our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation,
unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product
candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we obtain and maintain approval for MYDICAR from the FDA, we may never obtain approval for MYDICAR outside of the United
States, which would limit our market opportunities and adversely affect our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Approval in the United States by the FDA
does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of MYDICAR outside of
the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must
also approve the manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates in those countries and, if applicable, any required companion diagnostic. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review
periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be
approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products, if approved, is also subject to approval. While we may decide to submit an MAA to the EMA for approval in the EEA, obtaining such approval is a
lengthy and expensive process and the EMA has its own procedures for approval of product candidates. Even if a product is approved, the FDA or the EMA, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require
extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and the EEA also have requirements for
approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us
and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not
ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may
be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of MYDICAR will be
harmed and our business will be adversely affected. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some participants in our clinical trials have reported adverse effects after being treated with MYDICAR. If we are successful in
commercializing MYDICAR or any other products, FDA and foreign regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing
of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to
appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with
our reporting obligations, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future

failure, this agreement does not guarantee any particular outcome from regulatory review. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2012, we obtained an SPA from the
FDA for a potential Phase&nbsp;3 pivotal clinical trial of MYDICAR. The FDA&#146;s SPA process creates a written agreement between the sponsoring company and the FDA regarding clinical trial design and other clinical trial issues, such as the trial
endpoints, that can be used to support approval of a product candidate. The SPA is intended to provide assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed and the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, the data may serve as the
primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of a BLA. However, an SPA is not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, an SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if
previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, if other new scientific concerns regarding product candidate safety or efficacy arise or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed
upon clinical trial protocols. Moreover, an SPA does not address all of the variables and details that may go into planning for or conducting a clinical trial, and any change in the protocol for a clinical trial can invalidate an SPA or require the
sponsor to submit an amendment. Although our SPA with the FDA provides that the primary efficacy endpoint of time-to-recurrent heart failure-related hospitalizations in the presence of terminal events (all-cause death, heart transplant and LVAD
implantation) is acceptable for a potential Phase 3 pivotal trial of MYDICAR, the SPA specifically provides that the FDA&#146;s agreement to this point assumes certain elements, including the acceptance of certain simulation models by the FDA and
the validation by the FDA of the software used to implement the statistical model. In June 2013, the FDA advised us that it had concerns regarding the simulation results that we had submitted in favor of the trial model. Later in June 2013, we
responded to the FDA and provided it with software for data simulations and analysis supporting our proposed statistical model, however, the FDA may not agree with the sufficiency of our simulation models and software used to implement such models
and may request that we use an alternative statistical model. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notably, CUPID 2 is substantially similar in design to the SPA Phase&nbsp;3
protocol and uses the same primary efficacy endpoint. However, while we believe that the FDA&#146;s agreement in the SPA regarding the trial endpoints will support approval if the CUPID 2 trial is deemed a pivotal trial for purposes of BLA
submission, the SPA does not directly apply to the CUPID 2 trial. There can also be no assurance that the FDA will ultimately consider our SPA to be binding, particularly on the CUPID 2 trial that we are conducting. The FDA could assert that
additional data, including data obtained through one or more additional clinical trials, may be required to support a regulatory submission. In addition, while an SPA addresses the requirements for submission of a BLA, the results of the related
clinical trial may not support FDA approval. </P>

terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product candidate or companion diagnostic development activities may be delayed. Our reliance on these third parties for research and development
activities, including the conduct of any IND-enabling studies, reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards and any
applicable trial protocols. For example, for product candidates that we develop and commercialize on our own, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our IND-enabling studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the
trial plan and protocols.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or

diagnostic. Such suppliers may not sell these raw materials to our manufacturers at the times we need them or on commercially reasonable terms. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our
manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate or the
reagent for our companion diagnostic to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, a diagnostic reagent, or the raw material components thereof for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a
third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates or companion diagnostic. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw
materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates or companion diagnostic, our ability to commercially launch and/or generate revenues from the sale of any of our approved products or companion diagnostic would be
impaired. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails exposure to risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates or companion diagnostic ourselves, including: </P>

regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control
of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. We or our
contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA&#146;s good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and GMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection
program. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with GMP or failure to scale-up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or
failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates or companion diagnostic. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must also pass a pre-approval
inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or companion diagnostic. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility
involved with the preparation of our product candidates, companion diagnostic or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities and quality systems do not pass a

a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is

assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected. The FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and comparable
foreign regulatory authorities, enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our future
clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA, or other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our
clinical trials did not comply with GCPs. In addition, our future clinical trials will require a sufficient number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with
these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat such clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our CROs are not our employees, and we are therefore unable to directly monitor whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to
our clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities that could harm our
competitive position. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to
our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates.
If any such event were to occur, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. </P>

they reach the market. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other collaborative arrangement for any future product candidates or companion diagnostic because the potential partner may consider
that our research and development pipeline is insufficiently developed to justify a collaborative effort, or that our product candidates and programs do not have the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the target population.

we expect that our clinical development timeline would be delayed by at least one year. Moreover, we have not entered into a commercial-scale supply agreement with Lonza and Lonza has not yet manufactured our MYDICAR vector on a commercial scale.
Because of the complex nature of our product candidates, Lonza, or any other manufacturer with whom we may enter into an agreement, may not be able to manufacture our product candidates at a cost or in quantities or on timelines necessary for the

available treatments, changing standards of care, third-party payor reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, and the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge. We believe that approximately 60% of such potential
patients in the United States will be ineligible for treatment with MYDICAR due to the presence of pre-existing AAV1 NAbs which will neutralize the effectiveness of AAV-based vectors such as MYDICAR. In other countries, such as Poland, the
prevalence of pre-existing AAV-resistant antibodies is significantly higher. In addition, just one exposure to an AAV-based treatment such as MYDICAR may cause a patient to produce NAbs. Furthermore, other pharmaceutical companies could develop and
receive approval for new AAV-based treatments which could increase the number of patients that exhibit NAbs. We estimate that there are over 350,000 heart failure patients in the United States alone that will be eligible for MYDICAR therapy;
however, if the potential eligible patient population is lower than we anticipate, or if considerably more than 60% of potential patients exhibit NAbs, it could significantly and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of

demonstrated to be &#147;highly similar,&#148; or &#147;biosimilar,&#148; to or &#147;interchangeable&#148; with an FDA-approved biological product. This new pathway could allow competitors to reference data from biological products already approved
after 12 years from the time of approval. In addition, companies may be developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with our products. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our products,
our products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of our applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products,

displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the
benefits of the product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors.</P>

approved product candidates depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on
third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be
paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health coverage insurers and other
third-party payors. In addition, the market for MYDICAR and any of our other product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors&#146; formularies, or lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and
reimbursement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated
methods of controlling healthcare costs. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ
significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that adequate coverage and
reimbursement will be obtained. In many foreign countries, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country, and we may fail to obtain such reimbursement approvals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, decisions about Medicare coverage and reimbursement for new medicines are made by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp;
Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for administering the Medicare program. Private payors and other government payors often follow CMS&#146;s policies to a substantial degree,
making the Medicare determinations particularly </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
significant. It remains uncertain what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for
these new products. Similarly, outside the United States, we may not succeed in obtaining reimbursement approval from the relevant regulatory authorities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost
alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required CMS to reduce the Medicare clinical laboratory fee
schedule by 2% in 2013, which in turn serves as a base for 2014 and subsequent years. CMS also released final regulations whereby it will systematically re-examine and adjust payment amounts for tests reimbursed under the Medicare clinical
laboratory fee schedule due to changes in technology. The examination would seek to identify codes that had undergone technological changes affecting the price of the test. CMS will begin this process in 2014 with the first set of payment
adjustments to be effective on January&nbsp;1, 2015. In addition, CMS announced that it will bundle the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting beginning on
January&nbsp;1, 2014. Levels of reimbursement may be impacted by these initiatives and other current and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors in a manner that may harm the demand and reimbursement available
for our products, including our companion diagnostic, which in turn, could harm our product pricing and sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside the United States,
international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue
to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of medicines under such
systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could
restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate
commercially reasonable revenues and profits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party coverage and reimbursement for MYDICAR or any of our other product candidates
for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets and may vary substantially from our current assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Healthcare reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results
of operations. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was passed, which has the potential to substantially change health care financing by both governmental and private insurers, and
significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for
covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of
prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal
government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since
the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted
deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of
Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, delayed for another two months the budget
cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. On March&nbsp;1, 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and on April&nbsp;1, 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into
effect. The ATRA also reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, including physicians, hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to
providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and
services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we obtain approval to commercialize

qualified employees, we could experience such problems in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and
experience required by our industry. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We will need to hire
additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms, or at all, given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in preclinical studies or clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any
executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives. Furthermore, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been
improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output. </P>

activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among

manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to

product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may

requirements on public companies. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the
Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as &#147;say on pay&#148; and proxy access. Recent legislation permits smaller &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; to implement many of these
requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the pricing of their initial public offering. We intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner
than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and
disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact (in ways we cannot currently anticipate) the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of
time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to
make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. </P>

diagnostic are manufactured and distributed using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and
government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production risks. While product batches released for use in clinical trials or for commercialization undergo sample testing, some defects may only be identified
following product release. In addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in these intermediate products not complying with stability requirements or specifications. Most of our product candidates

product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays, substantial expense, lost sales and delays of new product launches. Any interruption in the supply of finished products or the loss thereof
could hinder our ability to timely distribute our products and satisfy customer demand. Any unforeseen failure in the storage of the product or loss in supply could delay our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, result in a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to
our product candidates and companion diagnostic. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail
to result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates and companion diagnostic in the United States or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and
patent applications has been found, which can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates or companion
diagnostic, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately
protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates or companion diagnostic or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties,
which may have an adverse impact on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our programs,
product candidates and companion diagnostic fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidates or companion diagnostic, it could dissuade companies
from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize, future products. Several patent applications covering our product candidates and companion diagnostic have been filed recently. We cannot offer any
assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patent or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other
patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates or companion diagnostic that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period
of time during which we could market a product candidate and companion diagnostic under patent protection could be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing,
and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to a product candidate or companion diagnostic. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference
proceeding in the United States can be initiated by a third party to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. In addition, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United
States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates and
companion diagnostic are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from generic medications. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and
confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our product candidates and companion diagnostic
discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in
part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of
our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security
measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we expect all of our employees and consultants to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and
any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other
confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Misappropriation or unauthorized
disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse
against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, is currently considering whether
to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA&#146;s disclosure policies may
change in the future, if at all.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in
the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the
non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our
market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we fail to comply with our

regulatory and/or commercial diligence obligations, payment of milestones and/or royalties and other obligations. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to
terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. Additionally, several of our existing license agreements are sublicenses from a third party who is not the original licensor of the intellectual
property at issue. Under these agreements, we must rely on our licensor to comply with their obligations under the primary license agreements under which such third party obtained rights in the applicable intellectual property, where we may have no

Because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or companion diagnostic may infringe, or which such third

in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our product candidates and companion diagnostic may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others.
We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is
a competitive area, and companies, which may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in

third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the
future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent
protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development
programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development partnerships or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through
breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor&#146;s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse
impact on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent

PTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, were
enacted in March 2013. It is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid
to the U.S. PTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and
rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The U.S. PTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions
during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules.
However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors
might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our business.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Issued patents covering our product

of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates or companion diagnostic, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate or
companion diagnostic, as applicable, is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous ground upon which a third
party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post
grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or related
companion diagnostics. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our
patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product
candidates and companion diagnostic. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. </P>

intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United
States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent
owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on
decisions by the U.S.&nbsp;Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S.&nbsp;PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and
patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the recent case, <I>Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,</I> the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. While we do not believe
that any of the patents owned or licensed by us will be found invalid based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the U.S. PTO may impact the value of our patents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our
intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal
and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the
United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have
patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions.
The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could
make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs
and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims
against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be
inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Intellectual property rights do

intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example: </P>

are not &#147;emerging growth companies,&#148; including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the
last day of the fiscal year (a)&nbsp;following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b)&nbsp;in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c)&nbsp;in which we are deemed to be a large
accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June&nbsp;30th, and (2)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt
during the prior three-year period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a

Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.
If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.</P>

apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that
are not emerging growth companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate
disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition,
any testing by us conducted in connection with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that
are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors
to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Sales of a

number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity

discretion, permit our officers, directors and other stockholders who are subject to these lock-up agreements to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements. Subject to certain limitations, including sales volume limitations with
respect to shares held by our affiliates, substantially all of our outstanding shares prior to our initial public offering on January&nbsp;29, 2014 will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the lock-up period. In addition, shares issued or
issuable upon exercise of options and warrants vested as of the expiration of the lock-up period will be eligible for sale at that time. Sales of stock by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common
stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, subject to the 180-day lock-up arrangement described above. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the

determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our

and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, had occurred since our
formation through December&nbsp;31, 2013. Based upon the results of this study, we determined that several ownership changes had occurred and that federal and California net operating loss carryforwards of $48.2&nbsp;million and $49.6&nbsp;million,
respectively, are available and federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of $662,000 and $1.2&nbsp;million, respectively, are available. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent
shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in
increased future tax liability to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our

prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such
transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may

our initial public offering of our common stock. Pursuant to the registration statement, we registered the offer and sale of 6,325,000 shares of our common stock. On February&nbsp;4, 2014, we sold 5,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public

biotechnology company applying our leadership position in the field of calcium dysregulation by targeting SERCA enzymes to develop novel therapies for diseases with tremendous unmet medical needs. Our therapeutic portfolio for diseases characterized
by SERCA enzyme deficiency includes both gene therapies and small molecule compounds. We are evaluating our lead product candidate, MYDICAR, in a 250-patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international Phase 2b trial in patients with
systolic heart failure, which we refer to as CUPID 2. We completed enrollment of CUPID 2 in February 2014 and expect to announce results in April 2015. If successful, these results, along with other studies, will form the basis for regulatory
submissions for approval with the FDA and the EMA. We also plan to develop MYDICAR for additional indications, such as AVF maturation failure, and for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure who are on an LVAD. Subject to raising
additional capital, we also may initiate development programs in diastolic heart failure, which is caused by the inability of the heart to relax normally between contractions, and PAH, which is characterized by a SERCA2a deficiency in VSMC. MYDICAR
has demonstrated potential disease-modifying capability in preclinical models of these diseases. We currently hold worldwide rights to MYDICAR and plan to commercialize MYDICAR for all approved heart failure indications using a targeted sales force
in the United States focused on selected cardiologists and heart failure specialists who treat the majority of heart failure patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
February 2014, we and Servier entered into a material transfer and exclusivity agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to transfer to Servier samples of certain proprietary compounds from our small molecule SERCA2b modulator program and granted to
Servier a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to conduct certain studies of the samples for the purpose of evaluating Servier&#146;s interest in negotiating a potential license and research collaboration agreement with us relating
to small molecule SERCA2b modulators, or Compounds, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Subject to earlier termination of the agreement as described below, the term of Servier&#146;s license to conduct the evaluation,
or the evaluation period, will expire six months after Servier&#146;s initial receipt from us of the samples, provided that Servier may extend the evaluation period for up to an additional two months. Under the terms of the agreement, we also
granted to Servier the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize Compounds, and products containing Compounds, in the field of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases, or the field,
solely outside of the United States and its territories and possessions, or ex-U.S. territory, on the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement and other commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated in good faith by the parties and set forth
in a definitive license and research collaboration agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a development-stage company. To date, we have devoted substantially

statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reported periods. We evaluate these estimates and
judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in
this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies related to clinical trial expenses, valuation of stock-based compensation and valuation of our convertible debt and warrant liability are the most critical for fully understanding
and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical Trial Accruals </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our
obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may
result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. Our clinical trial accrual is dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of CROs and other third-party vendors.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our objective is to reflect the appropriate clinical trial expenses in our consolidated financial statements by matching those expenses
with the period in which services and efforts are expended. We account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. We determine accrual estimates
through discussion with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust the rate of clinical trial expense
recognition if actual results differ from the estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect that our
estimates will be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of status and timing of services performed </P>

relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. Through December&nbsp;31,
2013, there had been no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. However, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we
become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense represents the grant date fair value of employee stock option grants recognized over the requisite service
period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after the point when the
achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for stock options granted to
non-employees using the fair-value approach. These options are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the
fair value of our stock options granted to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, (b)&nbsp;the expected
volatility of our stock, (c)&nbsp;the expected term of the award and (d)&nbsp;the expected dividend yield. Until our recently completed initial public offering, there was no public market for the trading of our common stock. Due to this fact and a
lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies
with comparable characteristics to ours, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical
volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of
historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the
vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S.&nbsp;Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. </P>

ownership. In general, if we experience a greater than 50% aggregate change in ownership of certain significant stockholders or groups over a three-year period, or a Section&nbsp;382 ownership change, utilization of our pre-change net operating loss
carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and similar state laws. The annual limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of our stock
at the time of such ownership change (subject to certain adjustments) by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the pre-change net operating loss carryforwards before utilization and may
be substantial. We completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, had occurred since our formation through December&nbsp;31, 2013. Based upon the results of this study, we determined that several
ownership changes had occurred and we reduced our deferred tax asset with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance accordingly. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the remaining portion of the deferred tax
asset related to our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable
income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. </P>

$13.3&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase of approximately $3.6&nbsp;million was due primarily to an increase of $4.5 million in expenses during 2013 associated with the increase in enrollment
of patients in our CUPID 2 clinical trial, $0.8 million associated with the transfer of our manufacturing process to Lonza and $1.5 million in compensation related to an increase in headcount and stock-based compensation, offset by a charge of $3.2
million which occurred during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 related to the purchase of intangible assets from AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation, or AmpliPhi, relating to the development of MYDICAR. We expect that our overall research and
development expenses will increase in 2014 as we initiate additional clinical trials and begin to scale-up for commercial manufacturing. </P>

ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase of approximately $0.4&nbsp;million was due primarily to an increase in compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and professional fees associated with transitioning our
company into a public company, offset by a reduction in outside legal services due to the completion of the establishment of our European subsidiary, Celladon Europe, and legal costs associated with licensing activities in 2012. We expect that our
general and administrative expenses will increase as we operate as a public company. We believe that these increases will likely include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance, costs related to the hiring of additional
personnel to support product commercialization efforts and increased fees for outside consultants, attorneys and accountants. We also expect to incur increased costs to comply with corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations and
disclosures, and similar requirements applicable to public companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other Income (Expense).</I> Other income (expense) was $(0.1)

outstanding warrant liability and $45,000 of interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount on our outstanding convertible debt, offset by $0.1 million of interest income on our investments. The other income for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2012 consisted primarily of interest income on our investments offset by interest expense on outstanding convertible debt. We expect our interest income to increase in 2014 as we invest the proceeds from our initial public offering
pending their use in our operations. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Recent Accounting Pronouncements </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued guidance to provide information about the amounts reclassified out
of accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI, by component. An entity is required to present, either on the face of the consolidated financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line
items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to
cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. On January&nbsp;1, 2013, we adopted this standard, which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No.&nbsp;2013-11,&nbsp;<I>Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When
a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists</I>. ASU 2013-11 provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a
similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2013, with an option for early adoption. We intend to adopt
this guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or related financial statement disclosures. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates.
Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low-risk profile of our investments, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market
interest rates on our investment portfolio. A 10% change in interest rates on December&nbsp;31, 2013 would not have had a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity. While we believe our cash
and cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash
equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our balance sheet as of
December&nbsp;31, 2013 includes cash and cash equivalents of $0.6&nbsp;million denominated in euros through Celladon Europe. The majority of payments made by Celladon Europe are denominated in euros. Such payments have not been material in any
period since our inception. We do not participate in any foreign currency hedging activities and we do not have any other derivative financial instruments. We did not recognize any significant exchange rate losses during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013. A 10% change in the euro-to-dollar exchange rate on December&nbsp;31, 2013 would not have had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material

Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

(Celladon or the Company) was incorporated in California on December&nbsp;21, 2000 (inception) and reincorporated in Delaware in April 2012. The Company changed its fiscal year end from June&nbsp;30 to December&nbsp;31, effective for the fiscal
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2011. The Company is a biotechnology company focused on developing treatments for heart failure, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Celladon&#146;s lead product candidate targets SERCA2a, an enzyme that becomes
deficient in patients with heart failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to
product development, raising capital and building infrastructure and has not generated revenues from its planned principal operations. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development stage. </P>

consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements requires it to make estimates and assumptions that impact
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant estimates in the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements relate to the fair value of equity awards, the fair value of the convertible debt and warrant liability, and clinical trial expense accruals. Although these estimates are based on the Company&#146;s knowledge of
current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. </P>

2013, the Company filed an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation under which each share of the Company&#146;s common stock was reverse split on a 1-for-12.49 basis. The Company&#146;s preferred stock conversion rate was
adjusted in an equivalent amount. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse split for all periods presented. </P>

April&nbsp;27, 2012, Celladon formed a subsidiary, Celladon Europe B.V. (Celladon EU), a Dutch limited liability company, for the purpose of managing the new capital investment made by Cooperatief LSP IV U.A. (LSP) related to Celladon&#146;s Series
A-1 preferred stock (see Note&nbsp;2). From its inception to June&nbsp;6, 2013 the subsidiary was 90% owned by Celladon and subsequent to June&nbsp;6, 2013 the subsidiary is wholly owned by Celladon. The financial statements of Celladon EU are
consolidated with those of the Company. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Celladon EU. The Company remeasures Celladon EU&#146;s assets and liabilities related
to monetary assets and liabilities to the U.S. dollar and records the net gains or losses resulting from remeasurement in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not record any material gains or losses from remeasurement. </P>

component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. A decline in the
market value of any investment security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary will result in an impairment charge to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. No such impairment charges were recorded for any
period presented. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and December&nbsp;31, 2012, none of the investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the
related security as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method and are included in interest income. Interest income is recognized when earned. </P>

equivalents and investment securities. The Company has established guidelines regarding diversification of investments and their maturities, which are designed to maintain principal and maximize liquidity. The Company maintains deposits in federally
insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the
depository institutions in which those deposits are held. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Property and Equipment </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
(generally three to five years) and generally consist of furniture and fixtures, computers, and office equipment. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment. An impairment loss is recorded if and when events and circumstances indicate
that assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. While the Company&#146;s current and historical operating losses and negative cash flows are
indicators of impairment, management believes that future cash flows to be received support the carrying value of its long-lived assets and, accordingly, has not recognized any impairment losses since inception. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Clinical Trial Accruals </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the
process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate its expenses resulting from its obligations under contracts with vendors and consultants and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials.
The financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts. The
Company&#146;s objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in its financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the
progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial. The Company determines accrual estimates through financial models taking into account discussion with applicable personnel and outside service
providers as to the progress or state of consummation of trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, the Company adjusts its rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from its estimates. The Company
makes estimates of its accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Although the Company does not expect its estimates to be materially different from amounts
actually incurred, its understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular
period. Through December&nbsp;31, 2013, there have been no material adjustments to the Company&#146;s prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials. The Company&#146;s clinical trial accrual is dependent upon the timely and accurate
reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Preferred Stock Warrant Liability </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has issued freestanding warrants to purchase shares of its convertible preferred stock. The fair value of these warrants is
classified as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock is classified as temporary equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets instead of in
stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) in accordance with authoritative guidance for the classification and measurement of redeemable securities. The warrants were recorded at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with any changes in
fair value being recognized as a component of other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Deferred Rent </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Deferred rent consists of
the difference between cash payments and the recognition of rent expense on a straight-line basis for the facility the Company occupies. The Company&#146;s lease for its facility provides for fixed increases in minimum annual rental payments. The
total amount of rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to rent expense ratably over the life of the lease. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company classifies preferred stock that is redeemable or subject to liquidation outside of the Company&#146;s control outside of permanent
equity. For preferred stock that is contractually redeemable outside of the Company&#146;s control, the carrying value was increased to its redemption value by accretion in the period of issuance. In the absence of retained earnings, these accretion
charges were recorded against additional paid-in capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Research and Development Costs </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses; fees paid to consultants and contract research
organizations; costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials; costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and maintenance and license payments related to licensed product candidates and technologies. All
research and development costs are expensed as incurred. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Patent Costs </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Costs related to filing and pursuing patent applications are recorded as general and administrative expense and expensed as incurred since
recoverability of such expenditures is uncertain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Stock-Based Compensation </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense represents the cost of the grant date fair value of employee stock option grants recognized over the requisite
service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for stock options granted to non-employees using the fair value approach. These option grants are subject to periodic
revaluation over their vesting terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Income Taxes </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial
statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that management believes these
assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,
tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, management would make an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company records uncertain tax positions on
the basis of a two-step process whereby (1)&nbsp;management determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2)&nbsp;for those tax positions that meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Any accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Comprehensive loss is defined as a change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. The Company&#146;s only component of other comprehensive loss is unrealized gains (losses) on investment securities. Comprehensive loss has been reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and as a separate
component of the statements of stockholders&#146; deficit for all periods presented. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. Dilutive common stock equivalents are comprised of convertible preferred stock and rights to acquire
convertible preferred stock (non-controlling interest), warrants for the purchase of common stock and options outstanding under the Company&#146;s stock option plans. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to
calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Company&#146;s net loss position. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Potentially dilutive securities not included

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued guidance to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), by component. An entity is required to present, either on the face of the consolidated financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of
net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to
cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. On January&nbsp;1, 2013, the Company adopted this standard, which had no impact on its financial position or results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.&nbsp;2013-11,&nbsp;<I>Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a
Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists</I>. ASU 2013-11 provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a
similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2013, with an option for early adoption. The Company intends
to adopt this guidance at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2014, and does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or related financial statement
disclosures. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. Celladon Europe B.V. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April&nbsp;2012 and June 2012, LSP invested an aggregate of $4.8&nbsp;million in Celladon EU. In exchange for the investment, the Company
issued LSP one share of Special Preferred Voting stock and Celladon EU issued LSP 1,999 non-voting B shares. The 1,999 B shares were exchangeable into 10,716,405 shares of the Company&#146;s Series&nbsp;A-1 preferred stock at the option of LSP. The
Company determined that the investment held by LSP in Celladon EU should be classified as a redeemable non-controlling interest, as the shares of Celladon EU were not in-substance common stock. In-substance common stock is an investment in an entity
that has risk and reward characteristics that are substantially similar to that entity&#146;s common stock. Due to the liability characteristics associated with the shares of Celladon EU held by LSP, the Company concluded that the investor&#146;s
shares were not substantially similar to common stock. The liability characteristics include the investor&#146;s put rights, which provide the investor with the ability to exchange its shares in Celladon EU for Series A-1 preferred stock of the
Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The redeemable non-controlling interest was initially valued using the fair value of the Series&nbsp;A-1 preferred stock. At
each reporting period, the Company adjusts the carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest by the net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest. Any difference between the fair value and the adjusted carrying value
of the redeemable non-controlling interest is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital and presented as a component of net loss attributable to common stockholders in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;6, 2013, LSP delivered a notice to exchange its 1,999 B shares of Celladon EU for 10,716,405 shares of
the Company&#146;s Series A-1 preferred stock. Concurrently, the one share of outstanding Special Preferred Voting stock was cancelled. As of June&nbsp;6, 2013, the redeemable non-controlling interest was adjusted to fair value and reclassified to
Series A-1 preferred stock on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From April 2012 through June&nbsp;6, 2013, LSP owned
approximately 10% of Celladon EU. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, the Company adjusted the loss attributable to
common stockholders as a result of increases in the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interest of approximately $3.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The increases in fair value increased the loss attributable to common
stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, the $0.8&nbsp;million and $0.3&nbsp;million, respectively, of liabilities recognized
as a result of consolidating Celladon EU do not represent additional claims on the Company&#146;s general assets; rather, they represent claims against the specific assets of Celladon EU. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, the $0.6&nbsp;million
and $3.6&nbsp;million, respectively, of assets recognized as a result of consolidating Celladon EU do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company&#146;s general assets. The assets of Celladon EU represent
the only significant assets of the Company not located in the United States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>3. Balance Sheet Details </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities. The carrying value of these financial instruments generally approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. Investment securities, warrant liabilities and redeemable non-controlling interest are recorded at fair value. Based on
the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, which is considered a Level 2 input, the Company believes that the fair value of its convertible debt approximates its carrying value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major
asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such
assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits with third-party financial institutions
and highly liquid money market securities with original maturities at date of purchase of 90 days or less and are stated at cost which approximate fair value and are classified within the Level 1 designation discussed above. Marketable securities
are recorded at fair value, defined as the exit price in the principal market in which the Company would transact, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. Level&nbsp;2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments, non-binding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or discounted cash flow techniques and include the Company&#146;s
investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper. Financial assets and liabilities that are measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, and are classified within the Level 3 designation, include the warrant liability and
redeemable non-controlling interest. None of the Company&#146;s non-financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. No transfers between levels have occurred during the periods presented. </P>

option pricing and probability weighted expected return model or, in the case of the December&nbsp;31, 2013, derived from the Company&#146;s IPO price. The key inputs into the models included the probability and timing of expected liquidity event

October 2013, the Company entered into a note and warrant purchase agreement with certain existing investors for the sale of up to an aggregate of $1,097,017 of convertible promissory notes (the 2013 Notes) and warrants exercisable to purchase
shares of Series&nbsp;A-1 Preferred Stock (the 2013 Warrants). Prior to their conversion in connection with the closing of the Company&#146;s initial public offering, the 2013 Notes accrued interest at a rate of 6%&nbsp;per annum, compounded
annually. The 2013 notes had a maturity date of the earlier of (1)&nbsp;March&nbsp;31, 2014 or (2)&nbsp;the occurrence of a deemed liquidation event as defined in the Company&#146;s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, subject in each
case to their earlier conversion upon the Company&#146;s completion of a qualified initial public offering or private placement of its equity securities. The terms of the 2013 Notes provided for their automatic conversion (including accrued
interest) upon a qualified initial public offering or private placement of equity securities into common stock or other equity securities issued in such private placement at a conversion price per share equal to the initial public offering price or
per share purchase price to investors in the private placement. The 2013 Warrants were exercisable for an aggregate of 2,895,570&nbsp;shares of Series&nbsp;A-1 Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $0.449 per share and will expire in October 2018.
Upon completion of the Company&#146;s initial public offering in February 2014, the 2013 Warrants became exercisable for an aggregate of 231,821 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.61 per share. </P>

predominant settlement mechanism. As this predominant settlement mechanism provided for the settlement of a fixed monetary amount in a variable number of equity instruments, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to recognize the 2013 Notes
at fair value. The Company valued the 2013 Notes utilizing an estimated cost of debt for comparable venture backed and mezzanine financings. The Company concluded that a 20% discount rate was appropriate, resulting in an initial fair value for the

as liabilities with subsequent changes in fair value recognized within the consolidated statement of operations. The Company determined that the initial fair value of the 2013 Warrants was $1.0 million. The fair value of the 2013 Warrants was
derived from the probability weighted expected return model the Company used to value its common stock. Upon completion of the Company&#146;s initial public offering in February 2014, the warrants no longer require liability accounting and the then

2009 with the Trustees of University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). Under the terms of the AmpliPhi Sublicense, the Company obtained an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from AmpliPhi under certain UPenn patents related to AAV1 vectors for the development,
manufacture, use and sale of companion diagnostics to MYDICAR. In addition, the Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to companion diagnostics

from the Company&#146;s formation through December&nbsp;31, 2013. Based upon this study, the Company determined that several ownership changes had occurred. Accordingly, the Company has reduced its deferred tax assets related to the federal and
state NOL carryforwards and the federal research tax credit carryforwards that are anticipated to expire unused as a result of these ownership changes. These tax attributes have been excluded from the deferred tax assets with a corresponding
reduction in the valuation allowance with no net effect on income tax expense or the effective tax rate. Future ownership changes may further limit the Company&#146;s ability to utilize its remaining tax attributes. </P>
