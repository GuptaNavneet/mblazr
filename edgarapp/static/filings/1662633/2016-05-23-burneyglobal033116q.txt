                 Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Global Marine Minerals, Inc. (formerly Burney Hill Acquisition Corporation
(the "Company") was incorporated on December 11, 2015 under the laws of the
state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including,
but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been
in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have
been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders, filing a
registration statement on Form 10 to register its class of common stock and
effecting a change in control.

The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company.  The
combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange
or stock-for-assets exchange. In most instances the target company will wish
to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be
successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has
been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to
become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed
to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited condensed financial
statements. Such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying
notes are the representations of the Company's management, who are responsible
for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in
preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") were omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results for the three months ended
March 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as
of March 31, 2016.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with
high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances
in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit as of March 31,
2016.

                 Notes to Unaudited  Financial Statements


INCOME TAXES

Under ASC 740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.  As of March 31, 2016 there were no deferred taxes due to the
uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior
to expiration.

LOSS PER COMMON SHARE

Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common
stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity.  As
of March 31, 2016, there are no outstanding dilutive securities.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements
of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally,
the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial
items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited
condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements
involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the
measurement date.

  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair
values because of the short maturity of these instruments.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes.  The
Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity
in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective of
the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas
of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and
complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness
of the information provided to users of financial statements. Current
GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and
assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes,
the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and
assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial
position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present
a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that
deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity
be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments
in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update
are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an
interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

On June 12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical Corrections and
Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range of Topics
in the Codification. The amendments in this Update represent changes to make
minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not
expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or
create a significant administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting
Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update
2014-240-Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been deleted.
Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this Update. The
amendments in this Update that require transition guidance are effective
for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be
effective upon the issuance of this Update. Management is in the process
of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.

                  Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements

On April 30, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-06 Earnings Per Share (Topic 260):
Effects on Historical Earnings per Units of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown
Transactions. Under Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, master limited partnerships
(MLPs) apply the two-class method to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because
the general partner, limited partners, and incentive distribution rights
holders each participate differently in the distribution of available cash.
When a general partner transfers (or "drops down") net assets to a master
limited partnership and that transaction is accounted for as a transaction
between entities under common control, the statements of operations of the
master limited partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the
dropdown transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which
the entities were under common control. The amendments in this Update
specify that for purposes of calculating historical EPU under the two-class
method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date
of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the general
partner interest, and previously reported EPU of the limited partners
would not change as a result of a dropdown transaction. Qualitative
disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ
before and after the dropdown transaction occurs also are required.
This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed
Accounting Standards Update EITF-14A Earnings Per Share Effects on
Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown
Transactions (Topic 260), which has been deleted. Effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments
in this Update should be applied retrospectively for all financial
statements presented. Management is in the process of assessing the
impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.

In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 Income
Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):
Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the
Concept of Extraordinary Items. The objective of this Update
is to simplify the income statement presentation requirements in
Subtopic 225-20 by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items.
Extraordinary items are events and transactions that are
distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency
of their occurrence. Eliminating the extraordinary classification
simplifies income statement presentation by altogether removing
the concept of extraordinary items from consideration. This
Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed
Accounting Standards Update 2014-220 Income Statement
Extraordinary Items (Subtopic 225-20), which has been deleted.
Effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
iscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting
entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity
also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods
presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted
provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption. The effective date is the same for both
public business entities and all other entities. Management is
in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU on the Company's
financial statements.

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN

The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and
has sustained operating loss of $5,462 from inception (December 11, 2015) to
March 31, 2016. The Company had working capital deficit of $4,000 and an
The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability
to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations
and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources,
as may be required.

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above
condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The
unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require
additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the
sale of its equity.  However, the Company currently has no commitments
from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable
to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly
reduce its current level of operations.

NOTE 3 - ACCRUED LIABILITIES

As of March 31, 2016, the Company had an accrued professional fee
of $4,000.

NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT

On December 11, 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000 founders common
stock to two directors and officers.  The Company is authorized to issue
100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred
stock. As of March 31, 2016, 20,000,000 shares of common stock and no
preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

NOTE 5 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

Subsequent to the period covered by this Report, on May 12,
2016, the Company effected the following transactions to effect a
change of control:

	The Company redeemed 19,500,000 of the 20,000,000 outstanding
      shares of common stock pro rata from the two shareholders thereof.

	The then current officers and directors of the Company resigned
       and new officers and directors were elected.

On May 13, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its common
stock pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 at par
representing 91% of the total outstanding 5,500,000 shares of common
stock to Jerry A. Hayes, the newly elected sole officer and director.

Management has evaluated subsequent events through May 23, 2016, the date
which the financial statements were available to be issued. All subsequent
events requiring recognition as of March 31, 2016 have been incorporated
into these financial statements and there are no other subsequent events
that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855, "Subsequent
Events."

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

	Global Marine Minerals, Inc. (formerly Burney Hill Acquisition
Corporation)(the "Company") was incorporated on December 11, 2015 under the
laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking,
including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The
Company is a blank check company and qualifies as an "emerging growth
company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which
became law in April, 2012.

    Since inception the Company's operations to date of the period covered
by this report have been limited to issuing shares of common stock to its
original shareholders, filing a registration statement on Form 10 with
the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as amended to register its class of common stock and effecting
a change in control of the Company subsequent to the period covered by this
report.

      The Company has no operations nor does it currently engage in any
business activities generating revenues.  The Company's principal
business objective is to achieve a business combination with a target
company.

      As of March 31, 2016 the Company had not generated revenues and
had no income or cash flows from operations since inception. The Company
had sustained net loss of $1,400 and had an accumulated deficit of
$5,462 for the three months ended and as of March 31, 2016, respectively.

    The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation of the
Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its
stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company

     Management will pay all expenses incurred by the Company.
There is no expectation of repayment for such expenses.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

      Subsequent to the period covered by this Report, on May 12,
2016, the Company effected the following transactions to effect a

      shares of common stock pro rata from the two shareholders thereof.

       and new officers and directors were elected.

      On May 13, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of its

Disclosures and Procedures

      Pursuant to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission,

required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed

reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and
communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

      This Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of
the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting.  Management's report was not subject
to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's
report in this Quarterly Report.

Changes in Internal Controls
