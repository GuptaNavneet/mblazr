In its evaluation of director candidates, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the current size and composition of our Board of Directors and the needs of our Board of Directors and the respective committees of our Board of Directors. Some of the qualifications that our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers include, without limitation, issues of character, integrity, judgment, diversity of experience, independence, area of expertise, corporate experience, length of service, potential conflicts of interest and other commitments. Nominees must also have the ability to offer advice and guidance to our Chief Executive Officer based on past experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility and be leaders in the companies or institutions with which they are affiliated. Director candidates must have sufficient time available in the judgment of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to perform all board of director and committee responsibilities. Members of our Board of Directors are expected to prepare for, attend, and participate in all board of director and applicable committee meetings. Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem, from time to time, are in our and our stockholders&#8217; best interests.</P>

<P align=justify style='font:10pt Times New Roman;margin:0;text-indent:36pt'>Risk assessment and oversight are an integral part of our governance and management processes. Our Board of Directors encourages management to promote a culture that incorporates risk management into our corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations. Management discusses strategic and operational risks at regular management meetings and conducts specific strategic planning and review sessions during the year that include a focused discussion and analysis of the risks we face. Throughout the year, senior management reviews these risks with the Board of Directors at regular board meetings as part of management presentations that focus on particular business functions, operations or strategies, and presents the steps taken by management to mitigate or eliminate such risks. Our Board of Directors does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through the Board of Directors as a whole, as well as through standing committees of the Board of Directors that will address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In particular, our Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and considers and approves or disapproves any related-person transactions. Our Nominating and Governance Committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines that we may adopt or amend from time to time. Our Compensation Committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking by our management.</P>

Our cash compensation policies are designed to encourage frequent and active interaction between directors and our executives both during and between formal meetings as well as compensate our directors for their time and effort. Further, we believe it is important to align the long-term interests of our non-employee directors (i.e. directors who are not employed by us as officers or employees) with those of the Company and its stockholders, and that awarding equity compensation to, and thereby increasing ownership of our common stock by, our non-employee directors is an appropriate means to achieve this alignment.

In addition, the Chairperson of the Audit Committee will receive a $5,000 annual retainer in cash. All cash fees are to be paid quarterly. In addition, prior to Mr. Rice's appointment as interim Chief Executive Officer, he received an hourly fee of $275 in connection with his service on the Board&#8217;s Special Projects Committee.

The 2013 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on October 10, 2013. Pursuant to the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company is authorized to grant &#8220;incentive stock options&#8221; and &#8220;non-qualified stock options&#8221;, grant or sell common stock subject to restrictions or without restrictions, and grant stock appreciation rights to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisers of the Company and its subsidiaries. Incentive stock options granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan are intended to qualify as &#8220;incentive stock options&#8221; within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). Non-qualified stock options granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan are not intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the Code. As of December 31, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 74,144 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, as well as options to purchase up to 101,188 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, some of which are subject to vesting restrictions, pursuant to the Company&#8217;s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. On April 28, 2016, an amendment to our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, to increase the number of shares of our common stock subject to the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan to 375,000.&nbsp;</P>

<P align=justify style='font:10pt Times New Roman;margin:0'><KBD style=margin-left:36pt></KBD>The purpose of the amendment is to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 7,500,000 shares to 30,000,000 shares. Of the 7,500,000 currently authorized shares of our common stock, 4,569,688 shares were issued and outstanding as of August 8, 2017, and, after taking into account shares subject to future issuance upon the exercise of our outstanding warrants, convertible promissory notes and outstanding stock options, only approximately 28,894 of the 7,500,000 authorized shares remain available for future issuance. &nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify style='font:10pt Times New Roman;margin:0'>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=justify style='font:10pt Times New Roman;margin:0'><KBD style=margin-left:36pt></KBD>Our Board of Directors believes the amendment is necessary and advisable in order to maintain our financing and capital raising flexibility in connection with our working capital needs and to generally maintain our flexibility in today&#8217;s competitive and fast-changing environment. Other possible business and financial uses for the additional shares of common stock include, without limitation, future stock splits, acquiring other companies, businesses or products in exchange for shares of common stock, attracting and retaining employees by the issuance of additional securities under our equity compensation plans and other transactions and corporate purposes that our Board of Directors deems to be in the Company&#8217;s best interest. The additional authorized shares would enable us to act quickly in response to opportunities that may arise for these types of transactions, in most cases without the necessity of obtaining further stockholder approval and holding a special stockholders&#8217; meeting before such issuance could proceed, except as provided under Nevada law and the NASDAQ Stock Market. &nbsp;</P>

(&quot;Dawson&quot;), to issue Dawson 141,000 shares of common stock in exchange for the surrender by Dawson of its Unit Purchase Option to acquire up to 70,500 units of the Company, each unit consisting of one share of the Company&#8217;s common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, subject to certain conditions.&nbsp;</P>

<P align=justify style='font:10pt Times New Roman;margin:0'><KBD style=margin-left:36pt></KBD>Upon issuance, the additional shares of authorized common stock would have rights identical to the currently outstanding shares of common stock. Adoption of the amendment would not have any immediate dilutive effect on the proportionate voting power or other rights of our existing stockholders. As is true for shares presently authorized but unissued, the future issuance of common stock authorized by the amendment may, among other things, decrease our existing stockholders&#8217; percentage equity ownership and, depending on the price at which they are issued, could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and have a negative effect on the market price of the common stock. Current stockholders have no preemptive or similar rights, which means current stockholders do not have a prior right to purchase any new issue of common stock in order to maintain their proportionate equity ownership thereof. &nbsp;</P>

For example, without further stockholder approval, our Board of Directors could sell shares of common stock in a private transaction to purchasers who would oppose a takeover or favor our current Board of Directors. Although this proposal to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock has been prompted by business and financial considerations and not by the threat of any known or threatened hostile takeover attempt, stockholders should be aware that approval of this proposal could facilitate future attempts by the Company to oppose changes in control of the Company and perpetuate our management, including transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.&nbsp;</P>
